# Using the provided scraping tool. 
`get_hd_images_serpapi.py`

To get high quality images from google we are using a third pary service `Serpapi`. 

# Setting up and running the scraper
To get started with the scraper we first need to get an API key from `serpapi`, we need this so that our API request can be authenticated.

Follow these steps to generate your own serpapi API key:

- Step 1: Go to `https://serpapi.com/`.
  
  `insert step 1 here`

- Step 2: Register yourself on the platform.
  
  `insert step 2 here`

- Step 3: You should see an API key on the dashboard.
  
  `insert step 3 here`

- Step 4: Copy that key that's what we need.
  
  `insert step 4 here`

- Step 5: Add the key you just copied to the .env file.
  
  `insert step 5 here`

- Step 6: If you haven't installed the project requirements install them from the requirements.txt file or by simply running `$ pip install -r requirements.txt
`.

- Step 7: Inside `get_hd_images_serpapi.py` add your search query for the images you want.
  
  `insert step 7 here`

- Step 8: Now run the code and wait till all the processing is done. Run by typing `py get_hd_images_serpapi.py` in your terminal. 
  
  `insert step 8 here`
