In the code we are using `Silenium`, it is a tool that helps developers control web browsers and make them do things automatically. It's like a helper that can click buttons, fill in forms, even go deep into pages, and navigate websites on its own.

# Setting up the scraper
In order to control and communicate to a web browser silenium uses a webdriver, it is a component that works with silenium to communicate to a web browser.

Here's how you can set up the web driver before using the scraper.
