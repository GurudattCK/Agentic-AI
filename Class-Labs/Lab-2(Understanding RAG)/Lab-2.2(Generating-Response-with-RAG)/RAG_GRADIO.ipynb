        "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines:\n",
        "- **Retrieval**: Finding relevant information from a knowledge base\n",
        "- **Generation**: Using an AI model to generate responses based on retrieved context\n",
        "\n",
        "## What You'll Learn:\n",
        "1. How to chunk documents for better retrieval\n",
        "2. Store document embeddings in ChromaDB\n",
        "3. Retrieve relevant chunks based on user queries\n",
        "4. Generate contextual responses using OpenAI\n",
        "5. Build an interactive interface with Gradio\n",
        "\n",

        "Upload File → Chunk Text → Create Embeddings → Store in ChromaDB → Query → Retrieve → Generate Response"

        "        - **Retrieval**: User queries are embedded and matched against stored chunks\n",
