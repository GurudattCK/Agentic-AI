# Lab README: Automation & Multi-Agent Workflows

## Overview

This repository contains two labs demonstrating enterprise-grade automation and multi-agent frameworks:

- Lab 1: Microsoft Power Automate integration with email and contract analysis (human-in-the-loop).
- Lab 2: Building multi-agent systems using Google Cloud’s Vertex AI.

## Lab 1: Power Automate Integration with Email and Contract Analysis

### Description

Microsoft Power Automate is a workflow automation tool that enables seamless integration of enterprise systems. In this lab, you will:

- Automate email-triggered workflows for contract analysis.
- Integrate a contract analysis agent to process incoming requests.
- Implement human-in-the-loop validation to ensure accuracy before finalizing outcomes.

## Lab 2: Multi-Agent Systems with Google Cloud Vertex AI

### Description

Google Cloud’s Vertex AI is a no-code platform for building and deploying multi-agent frameworks. In this lab, you will:

- Explore how AI agents use tools to collaborate and solve complex tasks.
- Connect multiple agents to work in tandem (e.g., data processing, decision-making).
- Deploy a scalable multi-agent system using Vertex AI’s enterprise-ready infrastructure.
