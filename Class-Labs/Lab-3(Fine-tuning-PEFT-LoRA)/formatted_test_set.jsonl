This master services agreement (this \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAgreement\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) governs all services that we perform for you, as well as any licenses, services, or products that we sell or re-sell to you (collectively, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cServices\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). b) Quotes.  The Services are not described in this Agreement; instead, we may perform a requested or required service  for you or, from time to time, we may provide you with a quote, proposal, service order, or similar electronic  document (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuote\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) proposing the Services.  A Quote may reference one or more additional documents, such as a  statement of work or statement of services (each a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cService Statement\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), that further defines or describes the scope,  terms, and/or provision of the Services.  By accepting a Quote, you also agree to the terms of each Service  Statement and the terms of this Agreement.  If you do not agree to the terms of the Service Statement and  this Agreement, then you should not accept the Quote. c) Versioning. The version of this Agreement can be identified by the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLast Updated\\xe2\\x80\\x9d reference located at the top of this  document.  Prior to agreeing to a Quote, you should refer back to this document and note the version of this  Agreement that applies to that particular Quote. d) Conflict.  If there is a specific, material difference or a direct conflict between the language in a Quote or Service  Statement on the one hand, and the language in this Agreement on the other, then the language of the Quote or  Service Statement (as applicable) will control. If there is a direct conflict between the language in a Quote and a  Service Statement, then the Quote will control.\\'}{\\'page_number\\': 2, \\'content\\': \\'d) Third Party Support.  If, in our discretion, a hardware or software issue requires vendor or OEM support, we may  contact the vendor or OEM (as applicable) on your behalf and invoice you for all fees and costs involved in that  process.  If the fees or costs are anticipated in advance or exceed $300, we will obtain your permission before  incurring such expenses on your behalf unless exigent circumstances require us to act otherwise.     e) Advice; Instructions.  From time to time, we may provide you with specific advice and directions related to the  Services (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAdvice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).

You are strongly advised to promptly follow our advice  which, depending on the situation, may require you to make additional purchases or investments in the  Environment at your sole cost. We are not responsible for any problems or issues (such as downtime or security- related issues) caused by your failure to promptly follow our Advice. If, in our discretion, your failure to follow our  Advice renders part or all of the Services economically or technically unreasonable to provide, then we may  terminate the applicable Services for cause by providing notice of termination to you. Unless specifically and  expressly stated in writing by us (such as in a Quote), any services required to remediate issues caused by your  failure to follow our Advice, or your unauthorized modification of the Environment, as well as any services  required to bring the Environment up to or maintain the Minimum Requirements, are out-of-scope.    f) Prioritization.

We will be entitled to rely on any directions or consent provided by your personnel or  representatives who are authorized to provide such directions or consent (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAuthorized Contacts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).

We reserve the  right, but not the obligation, to suspend part or all of the Services without prior notice to you in the event that  any portion of undisputed fees are not timely received by us.

{"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the provided Master Service Agreement, the contract does provide the opportunity for the service provider or customer to cure a material breach. \n\nOn page 4 of the agreement, under the section titled \"5.2 Termination,\" it states that each party has the right to terminate the agreement upon written notice if the other party materially breaches any of its obligations under the agreement and does not cure such material breach within thirty (30) days from the date of notice. This clause explicitly allows for the opportunity to cure a material breach before termination.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"If the contract allows the customer or service provider to terminate for a material breach, does the contract provide the opportunity for the service provider or customer to cure the material breach?\" is yes, the contract does provide the opportunity for the service provider or customer to cure the material breach.\n\nTo reach this conclusion, I analyzed the termination clause in the agreement and found that it explicitly allows for the opportunity to cure a material breach within thirty (30) days from the date of notice.

(d) Customer Maintenance. Repairs, upgrades, scheduled or Customer-requested service interruptions or modifications to a  Customer Service, scheduled in advance or in connection with a previously-agreed upon routine schedule.        (e) Customer Provided Equipment. Matters caused by or related to Customer provided equipment failure, malfunction or  configuration changes or failure to comply with facility installation guidelines.        (f) False Failures.

Matters which would otherwise be an Event but for a Customer-requested non-standard or  unsupported configuration including but not limited to use of power not supported by the data center UPS system and failure  to align equipment to designated hot and cold aisles.  For clarity, a non-standard configuration of power would invalidate the  Service Level obligations related to power but not to environmental envelope.  Non-standard configurations include, without  limitation, any Customer configuration which violates the standards set forth in Element Critical\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Data Center Policies and  Procedures or which Element Critical specifies as such at the time of ordering.      (h) Other.  Events arising out of Force Majeure or casualty and any access to Customer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cage, cabinet or rack that is the result  of a use of a weapon or threat of legal proceeding (e.g., use of a warrant).       3.  AMENDMENTS TO THE SLA    Element Critical reserves the right to amend the SLA. Element Critical shall give Customer not less than 30 days\\xe2\\x80\\x99 notice of any changes  in the SLA.  Upon receipt of such notice, Customer shall have the right, for a period of 30 days thereafter, to terminate the affected  Services if Customer reasonably disagrees with such amendment. Customer\\'s failure to object within 30 days\\' of receipt of changes  shall be deemed acceptance. (a) Provision of Services.  Element Critical will provide Customer with colocation and power services (the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cColocation  Services\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) in accordance with the terms and conditions contained herein for the term set forth in the Order. If Element Critical  is unable to commence providing Colocation Services by the Service Commencement Date, at Customer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s request Element  Critical will credit Customer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s account in the amount of 5% of the setup fee (non-recurring charge or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNRC\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) set out in the  Order for each day the Services are delivered late up to a maximum of 50% of the NRC.     (b) Scheduled Maintenance.  Except in the case of an emergency, Element Critical will provide Customer with seven (7)  calendar days\\xe2\\x80\\x99 notice of Scheduled Maintenance. If Element Critical fails to provide the appropriate notice, Customer will be  entitled to a credit to Customer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s account in the amount of the pro-rated fee for the provision of one day of Colocation  Services.  Element Critical will endeavor not to perform Scheduled Maintenance more than 12 times in any calendar year  and not exceed a total of 12 hours in any calendar year in any individual data center.  For each data center in which Customer  has a presence, Customer will be entitled to receive a credit to Customer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s account in the amount of one week of pro-rated  Colocation Services Fees for each Schedule Maintenance event beyond 12 and entitled to receive a credit to Customer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  account in the amount of the pro-rated fee for one day of Colocation Services for each hour of Schedule Maintenance beyond  12 hours in a calendar year.       (c) Power Availability.  Except as otherwise stated herein, Element Critical will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure  that the critical data center power infrastructure supporting the Colocation Services will be available 100% of the time.  If  Customer has purchased power circuits of the same size, delivered from two different power paths and designated as primary  and redundant power service (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRedundant Circuits\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) and both power services are unavailable at the same time within the  Customer environment due to a failure of the data center\\xe2\\x80\\x99s critical infrastructure, Customer shall be entitled 3% of the portion  of the MRC for the affected Service at the point the Service became unavailable and 3% for each 60 minute increment of  downtime from the point of initial violation, up to 100% of the MRC for the affected Service.  Power availability will be\"}{\\'page_number\\': 9, \\'content\\': \\'determined by Element Critical\\xe2\\x80\\x99s monitoring system at the point of demarcation.  The point of demarcation for the Customer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  environment for the purposes of power availability will be the power receptacle at Customer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cage, cabinet, rack or suite  and does not include Customer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s electrical connections within its cage, cabinet, or rack.     (d) Environmental Envelope.  Element Critical will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the supply average air  temperature in the cold aisle and relative humidity in the Element Critical data center will remain within ASHRAE TC9.9 A1  allowable range. Such commitment does not apply during scheduled maintenance, or as requested by Customer, or to  localized conditions within a particular Customer cage, cabinet, or rack.  If the data center\\xe2\\x80\\x99s environmental envelope falls  outside the specified ranges in the aggregate in any calendar month, Customer shall be entitled 3% of the portion of the  MRC for the affected Service at the point the Service fell outside the specified range and 3% for each 60 minute increment  during which the data center continues to operate outside the environmental envelope parameters from the point of the initial  violation, up to 100% of the MRC for the affected Service.      (e) Physical Security.  Element Critical will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that access to Customer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cage,  cabinet or rack will be monitored and controlled at all times. In the event of any Unauthorized Access to Customer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cage,  cabinet or rack, Customer will be entitled to of 25% of the portion of the MRC for the affected Service for each such  occurrence, up to 100% of such portion of the monthly recurring Colocation Services Fees for the affected Service.  For  determining Unauthorized Access, multiple simultaneous or concurrent event will be considered a single Unauthorized  Access notwithstanding that multiple persons may have simultaneously accessed the cage, cabinet or rack in an  unauthorized fashion.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUnauthorized Access\\xe2\\x80\\x9d means access into Customer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cage, cabinet or rack by a person that is not  (i) a person on Customer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s access list delivered to Element Critical and updated pursuant to Element Critical\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Policies and  Procedures, (ii) an employee or contractor/subcontractor of Element Critical performing Services, (iii) an emergency  responder responding to an emergency or to an event that could give rise to Element Critical liability under the SLA, or (iv) a  person gaining access through a warrant or other legal process.     (f) Cross Connect Availability.  Element Critical will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that cross connections will  be available at all times.  A cross connection is considered to be unavailable when the physical media used to provide the  connection fails and is unable to support communication between the end points.  In the event that a cross connection  becomes unavailable, Element Critical commits to restoring the connection within 4 hours of Customer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s notification of  Element Critical Data Center Operations at either 888-298-5375 or support@elementcritical.com.  Should Element Critical  fail to restore the cross connection within 4 hours of notification, Customer will be entitled to receive a credit of one month\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  recurring revenue for the affected Service.     5.  SERVICE CREDIT ESCALATORS AND OTHER REMEDIES     (a) Second Event. Element Critical will pay out Service Credits at 200% of the amounts listed above in sections 4(c), (d), (e),  and (f), up to 100% of the MRC for the affected Service, for the second qualifying Event of the same Service Level with the  same root cause during a calendar month.      (b) Chronic Trouble. Customer may terminate an Order for cause if Customer experiences \\xe2\\x80\\x9cChronic Trouble\\xe2\\x80\\x9d under an  applicable SLA for the Services in such Order.  Chronic Trouble means Customer has experienced more than three Events  with the same Service, as determined by Element Critical acting reasonably, within a 90-day period measured from the date  of the first Event.  Additionally, if a Service Level violation specified in sections 4(c) Power Availability or 4(d) Environmental  Envelope, persist for more than 72 consecutive hours, Customer may terminate the Order containing the affected Service(s)  but not this Agreement, for cause.  Customer must give written notice of their intent to terminate the affected Services within  30 days of the Event or 72-hour Event triggering Chronic Trouble.  Said termination will be Customer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sole and exclusive  remedy for the applicable Chronic Trouble or 72-hour Event.  Said termination will take effect 30 days after Customer gives  Element Critical the termination notice.

{"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the provided Master Service Agreement, the question asks whether the customer is required to indemnify the service provider for attorney's fees if the agreement requires the customer to indemnify the service provider.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to analyze the relevant clauses in the Master Service Agreement. \n\nIn the given agreement, there are several clauses related to indemnification and liability. Clause 9.1 states that each party will defend any suit brought against the other party and pay any settlement or damages awarded in such a suit, insofar as the suit is based on a claim of infringement of intellectual property rights or a breach of warranty. However, this clause does not explicitly mention attorney's fees.\n\nClause 7.1 discusses the types of damages and states that neither party or its respective suppliers shall be liable for any special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, incidental, or consequential damages, including damages or costs due to loss of profits, data, revenue, goodwill, production, or use, business interruption, procurement of substitute goods or services, or personal or property damage. This clause also does not specifically address attorney's fees.\n\nClause 7.2 further limits the liability of either party arising out of or connected to the agreement to the fees paid or due to be paid by the customer to the service provider during the twelve-month period preceding the event giving rise to the liability. Again, this clause does not mention attorney's fees.\n\nBased on the analysis of the relevant clauses, it can be concluded that the Master Service Agreement does not explicitly require the customer to indemnify the service provider for attorney's fees. The agreement does not contain any specific provision addressing attorney's fees in the context of indemnification.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is No, the customer is not required to indemnify the service provider for attorney's fees based on the provided Master Service Agreement."}

Client accepts these Terms by signing an Order, using the services, or  continuing to use the services after being notified of a change to these Terms.  If there is a  conflict between the Order, this Master Services Agreement, any Service Attachment, or  Exhibit, the Order will control.  The parties agree as follows:  STATEMENT OF SERVICES  Service Attachments  The services to be delivered by Provider (the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cServices\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) and the fees for those Services, and  the specific terms applicable to those Services are described in the Order or in one or more  Service Attachments referencing this Agreement.  Except for Supplemental Services or Project Services (described below), and unless otherwise  agreed in writing, the services Provider will deliver to Client are limited to those Services  specifically identified in the Order and described in the Service Attachments or Schedule of  Services. In the event of any conflict between the terms of a Service Attachment or Schedule of  Services and this Agreement, the terms in the Service Attachment or Schedule of Services  control.  In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and of an Order and  any Service Attachment or Schedule of Services, the terms of the Order control.   Provider may decline to perform any services requested by Client that are in violation of any  applicable law or that are not typically associated with the Services provided by Provider.   Supplemental Services  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSupplemental Services\\xe2\\x80\\x9d include additional services and equipment Client may need on a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cone- off\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or emergency basis that are not included within the scope of the Services described in an  Order or the applicable Service Attachments. You will incur additional Service Fees for  Supplemental Services. We will notify Client of any such additional Service Fees and will obtain  Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s approval prior to providing them. However, Provider has no obligation to determine the  need for or to provide any Supplemental Services. All Supplemental Services are provided on  an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas-is\\xe2\\x80\\x9d basis and include no warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. In addition, if  Provider determines that any additional services Client requests would be inappropriate for  treatment as Supplemental Services under this paragraph, Provider may deliver to Client a  proposed Service Attachment for Project Services or a Proposal prior to providing Supplemental  Services.  Project Services  In some cases, Client may ask Provider to deliver services outside the scope of any Order or \\xc2\\xa9 Scott & Scott, LLP   ON\\xc2\\xae\\'}{\\'page_number\\': 2, \\'content\\': \\'\\xc2\\xa9 Scott & Scott, LLP      Service Attachment and inappropriate for treatment as Supplemental Services. Examples of  such services include major system upgrades, new computer, machine or device setup, network  changes, datacenter moves or setups, or installations. In those cases, Provider will prepare a  separate Service Attachment for Project Services describing the proposed scope of those  services and Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fee to deliver them. Installation dates are estimates only. Client shall be  responsible for preparation and maintenance of the site for such Project Services or  installations, including, but not limited to, providing necessary electrical power and  communication lines and proper air conditioning and humidity control.    FEES FOR SERVICES | PAYMENT TERMS    Service Fees  Fees for Services are set forth in Order or Statement of Work. Unless otherwise indicated in  writing, all Services will be performed on a time-and-materials basis at Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s then-current  rates.    Adjustments to Service Fees  Except as may be specified in an Order, Provider may adjust the Service Fees charged under  this Agreement as follows: \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  End-User or Network Growth. During the term of an Order, if the number of users or  devices in Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s environment or the Service or Equipment types or quantities to be  covered within the scope of the Order exceeds the numbers, types or quantities  previously ordered, Provider may apply a pro rata adjustment to the total Service Fees.  You shall pay all Service Fees owed as they become due following any such adjustment.    Similarly, during the term of an Order, if the number of users or devices in Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  environment or the Service or Equipment types or quantities to be covered within the  scope of the Order is less than the numbers, types or quantities previously ordered,  upon request, Provider will apply a pro rata adjustment to the total Service Fees. You  shall pay all Service Fees owed as they become due following any such adjustment.  However, under no circumstances may any such adjustments result in a number of  users or devices in Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s environment or in any Service or Equipment types or  quantities to be covered within the scope of the Order that is less than the numbers,  types or quantities ordered at the time Client signed that Order.     \"User\" means Client\\\\\\'s employees, consultants, contractors or agents who are authorized  to use the Service and have been supplied user identifications and passwords by Client  (or by Provider upon Client\\\\\\'s request). Users do not include any customers of Client or  other third parties.     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDevice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d means any equipment included in the Services, whether owned by Client or  provided by Provider for Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s use, including, but not limited to computers, printers,  servers, routers, and mobile or handheld microcomputers as well as the software  necessary to operate such equipment.\\'}{\\'page_number\\': 3, \\'content\\': \\'\\xc2\\xa9 Scott & Scott, LLP      Service Fees owed as they become due following any such adjustment.    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Service Fee Rate Increases. At any time after the parties sign an Order, Provider may  elect to raise the fees that it charges under that Order.  If the increase is greater than  10% annually, Provider shall give Client no less than thirty (30) days\\xe2\\x80\\x99 notice of any such  increase in fees to be charged. Following Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s receipt of such notice, Client may  terminate the Order without incurring any additional charges or penalties, if any, that  Client ordinarily would incur for such termination.    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Third-Party Services. Client understands and agrees that Provider uses third-party  solutions and service providers to perform some or all of the managed services offered  to Client (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThird-Party Service Providers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).  PROVIDER IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR  THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS.  CLIENT\\xe2\\x80\\x99S  RIGHTS REGARDING CLAIMS AGAINST THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS  SHALL BE GOVERNED BY SUCH SERVICE PROVIDER\\xe2\\x80\\x99S END USER LICENSE  AGREEMENT OR TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s current Third-Party Service  providers and the governing terms and conditions related to those services are listed on  the Schedule of Third-Party Services which may be updated by Provider without further  notice to Client and is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth in this Agreement.      \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Off-Boarding. Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cancellation, termination, or transition of the Services to Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  control or to another service provider (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOff-Boarding\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) may trigger a billable project.  Any  Off-Boarding projects will be subject to a separate Order or Project Service Attachment  or Statement of Work, which will be billed at Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s then-prevailing rates.    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Client Delay.  If Provider is unable to commence delivery of the Services on the service  start date because of any failure on Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s part including but not limited to the failure to  provide access to Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s resources in a timely manner, Client nonetheless will begin to  incur Service Fees, which Client shall pay in accordance with the Order, the Service  Attachment and the Master Services Agreement. Pass-Through Expenses  Client shall pay Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including incremental third-party  service fees, travel expenses, lodging, meals, or other similar expenses, which may be incurred  by Provider in performing Services. Any such \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPass-Through Expenses\\xe2\\x80\\x9d will be billed at cost  and invoiced monthly.    Payment Terms  Client shall pay the full amount reflected on any invoice as owed to Provider on the first (1st)  day of each month. Without waiving any of its other remedies, Provider reserves the right to  suspend services if payment is not received within thirty (30) days following Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s receipt of  that invoice. Client shall pay a late charge of one- and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the  maximum lawful rate, whichever is less, for all invoiced amounts not paid within thirty (30) days  following Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s receipt of that invoice (the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPayment Deadline\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).     If Client disputes in good faith all or any portion of the amount owed to us, or if Client otherwise  requests any adjustment to an invoiced amount, Client must notify Provider in writing, prior to  the Payment Deadline, of the nature and basis of the dispute and/or adjustment. If Provider is  unable to resolve the dispute prior to the Payment Deadline, Client nevertheless shall pay the  entire invoiced amount by the Payment Deadline. If Provider ultimately determines that such\\'}{\\'page_number\\': 4, \\'content\\': \\'amount should not have been paid, Provider shall apply a credit equal to such amount against  any Service Fees owed for the following month.    Special rates may apply for services requested outside of normal business hours or on holidays.  Special rates are one-and-one-half (1.5) times normal hourly rates, with a one-hour minimum.  Holiday hour rates are two (2) times normal hourly rates, with a one-hour minimum.    Suspension of Service  If Client fails to pay all amounts owed under this Agreement when due, then upon at least ten  (10) business days\\xe2\\x80\\x99 prior written notice, and in addition to any other remedies available to  Provider, Provider may suspend Services and withhold Confidential Information (defined below)  under this Agreement until full payment is made. Following any suspension of service under this  provision, and after Client makes full payment to Provider, Provider may restore the Services  after validating that all components to be monitored and/or managed under any applicable  Order or Service Attachment comply with Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s level of security, updates, and best  practices. Client shall pay a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReactivation Fee\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for such restoration equal to one month of the  Service Fees. Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right to suspend Services under this section is in addition to Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  right to terminate this Agreement.    Taxes  Unless otherwise indicated on an invoice, all charges and fees owed under this Agreement are  exclusive of any applicable sales, use, excise, or services taxes that may be assessed on the  provision of the Services. In the event that any taxes are assessed on the provision of any of the  Services, Client shall pay the taxes directly to the taxing authority or shall reimburse Provider for  their payment.    TERM AND TERMINATION    Term  This Agreement commences on the Order Effective Date, and it will remain in effect until either  party terminates it as permitted below.    Month-to-Month Services  If the Order specifies no Initial Term with respect to any or all Services, then Provider will deliver  those Services on a month-to-month basis until one party provides written notice to the other  party of its intent to terminate those Services, in which case Provider will cease delivering those  Services at the end of the next calendar month following receipt of such written notice by the  other party.    Trial Period  Provider offers a trial period for a limited number of Services.  If a trial period is included in the  Order, Client may cancel during the trial period without paying a termination fee for those  Services. To cancel during the trial period, Client must provide thirty (30) days\\xe2\\x80\\x99 written notice  and pay all Service Fees due up to the date of termination.    Termination  Either party may terminate this MSA for any reason or no reason upon at least thirty (30) days  advance, written notice given to the other party. However, termination of this MSA will not, by  itself, result in the termination of any Order or Service Attachments, and this MSA will remain in  effect notwithstanding any notice of termination unless and until all Orders and/or Service  Attachments are terminated or expire according to their terms.\\'}{\\'page_number\\': 5, \\'content\\': \\'\\xc2\\xa9 Scott & Scott, LLP        INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR  Unless otherwise agreed, Provider will perform all Services solely as an independent contractor  and not as an employee, agent, or representative of Client.

Client further hereby irrevocably assigns to Provider all of its patent, copyright,  trade secret, know-how, and other proprietary and associated rights in any Provider Work.    License to Provider Works  If any Provider Work is located on hardware or equipment owned by Client, Provider hereby  grants Client a perpetual, non-exclusive, revocable, royalty-free license to use any Provider  Work during the term of this Agreement (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLimited License\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).  The Limited License will be  immediately and automatically revoked without the need for notice in the event that either party  terminates the Services or this Agreement.\\'}{\\'page_number\\': 13, \\'content\\': \"COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS  Provider shall comply with all laws applicable to Provider in its role as a Managed IT Provider.  For the avoidance of doubt, unless otherwise provided in a separate Data Processing  Agreement (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDPA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), Provider is not responsible for complying with the laws applicable to Client  or Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s industry. Client shall comply with all laws applicable to Client or in Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s industry.    Although it is under no obligation to do so, from time to time, Provider may make  recommendations regarding legal requirements and regulatory compliance protocols related to  Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s network and practices. If Client fails to adopt or implement the recommended legal  requirements or regulatory compliance protocols, Client is responsible for any and all damages  related to legal and regulatory compliance. Even if Client does take Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s advice regarding  legal requirements and regulatory compliance protocols, Provider does not take responsibility  for any legal requirements and regulatory compliance protocols or audits.    NO HIRING  Client shall not solicit for employment with Client any Provider employee with whom Client has  had direct contact in connection with the Services during the Term of this Agreement and for  twelve (12) months following termination of this Agreement.     Client acknowledges that injury resulting from any breach of this provision would be significant  and irreparable and that it would be extremely difficult to ascertain the actual amount of  damages resulting from such breach. Therefore, in the event of a violation of this provision, in  addition to any other right Provider may have at law or in equity, Client shall make a one-time  payment to Provider in the amount of one hundred percent (100%) of the affected employee\\'s  base salary for one year, which accurately reflects the reasonable value of the employee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time  and costs. We agree that such amount is not intended as a penalty and is reasonably calculated  based upon the projected costs the injured party would incur to identify, recruit, hire, and train  suitable replacements for such personnel.    DISPUTE RESOLUTION    Arbitration Procedures  Each party shall attempt to settle amicably by mutual discussions any disputes, differences, or  claims related to this Agreement within sixty (60) days of the date any such dispute arises.  Failing such amicable settlement, any such dispute, including claim related to the existence,  validity, interpretation, performance, termination, or breach of this Agreement, is to be settled by  arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association  (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAAA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). The arbitration will be conducted in English and will have one (1) arbitrator. The  Arbitrator will not have the authority to award punitive damages to either party. Each party will  bear its own expenses, but shall share equally the expenses of the Arbitration Tribunal and the  AAA. Any arbitration award will be final, and judgment thereon may be entered in any court of  competent jurisdiction.  The arbitration will be held in the city where Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s headquarters are  located, or at another location upon which the parties may agree. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  claims for preliminary injunctive relief, other pre-judgment remedies, and claims for Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  failure to pay for Services may be brought in a state or federal court in the United States with  jurisdiction over the subject matter and parties.    Period for Bringing Claim  No claims may be made more than six (6) months after the date by which the fault or failure  should reasonably have been discovered; failure to make such a claim within the six (6) month  period shall forever bar the claim.\"}{\\'page_number\\': 14, \\'content\\': \\'\\xc2\\xa9 Scott & Scott, LLP        Continued Service  Unless Provider is bringing an action for Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s failure to make payments for Services not  otherwise in dispute, Provider will continue to provide Services under this Agreement, and Client  shall continue to make payments to us, in accordance with this Agreement, during the period in  which the parties seek resolution of the dispute.

If Client transfers its rights, interests, and obligations under this Agreement  without Provider consent, then such assignment will not be valid, and Client shall remain  responsible for all Fees under this Agreement and any Attachment regardless of whether Client  continues to derive any benefit from the Services. In addition, unless otherwise agreed, Provider  may contract with third parties to deliver some or all of the Services, and no such third-party  contract is to be interpreted as an assignment of this Agreement. However, Provider will use  commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any and all such third parties abide by all of the  terms of this Agreement, and, except as otherwise agreed, Provider will remain solely  responsible for the fulfillment of all of Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s obligations under this Agreement.

At any time after the parties sign an Order, Provider may adjust its rates  and charges or impose additional rates and charges to recover amounts required or  permitted by governmental or quasi-governmental authorities to collect from others or  pay to others in support of statutory or regulatory funds or programs. You shall pay all \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  End-User or Network Growth. During the term of an Order, if the number of users or  devices in Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s environment or the Service or Equipment types or quantities to be  covered within the scope of the Order exceeds the numbers, types or quantities  previously ordered, Provider may apply a pro rata adjustment to the total Service Fees.  You shall pay all Service Fees owed as they become due following any such adjustment.    Similarly, during the term of an Order, if the number of users or devices in Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  environment or the Service or Equipment types or quantities to be covered within the  scope of the Order is less than the numbers, types or quantities previously ordered,  upon request, Provider will apply a pro rata adjustment to the total Service Fees. You  shall pay all Service Fees owed as they become due following any such adjustment.  However, under no circumstances may any such adjustments result in a number of  users or devices in Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s environment or in any Service or Equipment types or  quantities to be covered within the scope of the Order that is less than the numbers,  types or quantities ordered at the time Client signed that Order.     \"User\" means Client\\\\\\'s employees, consultants, contractors or agents who are authorized  to use the Service and have been supplied user identifications and passwords by Client  (or by Provider upon Client\\\\\\'s request). Users do not include any customers of Client or  other third parties.     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDevice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d means any equipment included in the Services, whether owned by Client or  provided by Provider for Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s use, including, but not limited to computers, printers,  servers, routers, and mobile or handheld microcomputers as well as the software  necessary to operate such equipment.\\'}{\\'page_number\\': 3, \\'content\\': \\'\\xc2\\xa9 Scott & Scott, LLP      Service Fees owed as they become due following any such adjustment.    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Service Fee Rate Increases. At any time after the parties sign an Order, Provider may  elect to raise the fees that it charges under that Order.  If the increase is greater than  10% annually, Provider shall give Client no less than thirty (30) days\\xe2\\x80\\x99 notice of any such  increase in fees to be charged. Following Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s receipt of such notice, Client may  terminate the Order without incurring any additional charges or penalties, if any, that  Client ordinarily would incur for such termination.    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Third-Party Services. Client understands and agrees that Provider uses third-party  solutions and service providers to perform some or all of the managed services offered  to Client (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThird-Party Service Providers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).  PROVIDER IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR  THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS.  CLIENT\\xe2\\x80\\x99S  RIGHTS REGARDING CLAIMS AGAINST THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS  SHALL BE GOVERNED BY SUCH SERVICE PROVIDER\\xe2\\x80\\x99S END USER LICENSE  AGREEMENT OR TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s current Third-Party Service  providers and the governing terms and conditions related to those services are listed on  the Schedule of Third-Party Services which may be updated by Provider without further  notice to Client and is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth in this Agreement.      \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Off-Boarding.

Any  Off-Boarding projects will be subject to a separate Order or Project Service Attachment  or Statement of Work, which will be billed at Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s then-prevailing rates.    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Client Delay.  If Provider is unable to commence delivery of the Services on the service  start date because of any failure on Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s part including but not limited to the failure to  provide access to Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s resources in a timely manner, Client nonetheless will begin to  incur Service Fees, which Client shall pay in accordance with the Order, the Service  Attachment and the Master Services Agreement. Pass-Through Expenses  Client shall pay Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including incremental third-party  service fees, travel expenses, lodging, meals, or other similar expenses, which may be incurred  by Provider in performing Services. Any such \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPass-Through Expenses\\xe2\\x80\\x9d will be billed at cost  and invoiced monthly.    Payment Terms  Client shall pay the full amount reflected on any invoice as owed to Provider on the first (1st)  day of each month. Without waiving any of its other remedies, Provider reserves the right to  suspend services if payment is not received within thirty (30) days following Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s receipt of  that invoice. Client shall pay a late charge of one- and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the  maximum lawful rate, whichever is less, for all invoiced amounts not paid within thirty (30) days  following Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s receipt of that invoice (the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPayment Deadline\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).     If Client disputes in good faith all or any portion of the amount owed to us, or if Client otherwise  requests any adjustment to an invoiced amount, Client must notify Provider in writing, prior to  the Payment Deadline, of the nature and basis of the dispute and/or adjustment. If Provider is  unable to resolve the dispute prior to the Payment Deadline, Client nevertheless shall pay the  entire invoiced amount by the Payment Deadline. If Provider ultimately determines that such\\'}{\\'page_number\\': 4, \\'content\\': \\'amount should not have been paid, Provider shall apply a credit equal to such amount against  any Service Fees owed for the following month.    Special rates may apply for services requested outside of normal business hours or on holidays.  Special rates are one-and-one-half (1.5) times normal hourly rates, with a one-hour minimum.  Holiday hour rates are two (2) times normal hourly rates, with a one-hour minimum.    Suspension of Service  If Client fails to pay all amounts owed under this Agreement when due, then upon at least ten  (10) business days\\xe2\\x80\\x99 prior written notice, and in addition to any other remedies available to  Provider, Provider may suspend Services and withhold Confidential Information (defined below)  under this Agreement until full payment is made. Following any suspension of service under this  provision, and after Client makes full payment to Provider, Provider may restore the Services  after validating that all components to be monitored and/or managed under any applicable  Order or Service Attachment comply with Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s level of security, updates, and best  practices. Client shall pay a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReactivation Fee\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for such restoration equal to one month of the  Service Fees. Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right to suspend Services under this section is in addition to Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  right to terminate this Agreement.    Taxes  Unless otherwise indicated on an invoice, all charges and fees owed under this Agreement are  exclusive of any applicable sales, use, excise, or services taxes that may be assessed on the  provision of the Services. In the event that any taxes are assessed on the provision of any of the  Services, Client shall pay the taxes directly to the taxing authority or shall reimburse Provider for  their payment.    TERM AND TERMINATION    Term  This Agreement commences on the Order Effective Date, and it will remain in effect until either  party terminates it as permitted below.    Month-to-Month Services  If the Order specifies no Initial Term with respect to any or all Services, then Provider will deliver  those Services on a month-to-month basis until one party provides written notice to the other  party of its intent to terminate those Services, in which case Provider will cease delivering those  Services at the end of the next calendar month following receipt of such written notice by the  other party.    Trial Period  Provider offers a trial period for a limited number of Services.  If a trial period is included in the  Order, Client may cancel during the trial period without paying a termination fee for those  Services. To cancel during the trial period, Client must provide thirty (30) days\\xe2\\x80\\x99 written notice  and pay all Service Fees due up to the date of termination.    Termination  Either party may terminate this MSA for any reason or no reason upon at least thirty (30) days  advance, written notice given to the other party. However, termination of this MSA will not, by  itself, result in the termination of any Order or Service Attachments, and this MSA will remain in  effect notwithstanding any notice of termination unless and until all Orders and/or Service  Attachments are terminated or expire according to their terms.\\'}{\\'page_number\\': 5, \\'content\\': \\'\\xc2\\xa9 Scott & Scott, LLP        INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR  Unless otherwise agreed, Provider will perform all Services solely as an independent contractor  and not as an employee, agent, or representative of Client.

Client further hereby irrevocably assigns to Provider all of its patent, copyright,  trade secret, know-how, and other proprietary and associated rights in any Provider Work.    License to Provider Works  If any Provider Work is located on hardware or equipment owned by Client, Provider hereby  grants Client a perpetual, non-exclusive, revocable, royalty-free license to use any Provider  Work during the term of this Agreement (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLimited License\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).  The Limited License will be  immediately and automatically revoked without the need for notice in the event that either party  terminates the Services or this Agreement.\\'}{\\'page_number\\': 13, \\'content\\': \"COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS  Provider shall comply with all laws applicable to Provider in its role as a Managed IT Provider.  For the avoidance of doubt, unless otherwise provided in a separate Data Processing  Agreement (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDPA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), Provider is not responsible for complying with the laws applicable to Client  or Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s industry. Client shall comply with all laws applicable to Client or in Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s industry.    Although it is under no obligation to do so, from time to time, Provider may make  recommendations regarding legal requirements and regulatory compliance protocols related to  Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s network and practices. If Client fails to adopt or implement the recommended legal  requirements or regulatory compliance protocols, Client is responsible for any and all damages  related to legal and regulatory compliance. Even if Client does take Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s advice regarding  legal requirements and regulatory compliance protocols, Provider does not take responsibility  for any legal requirements and regulatory compliance protocols or audits.    NO HIRING  Client shall not solicit for employment with Client any Provider employee with whom Client has  had direct contact in connection with the Services during the Term of this Agreement and for  twelve (12) months following termination of this Agreement.     Client acknowledges that injury resulting from any breach of this provision would be significant  and irreparable and that it would be extremely difficult to ascertain the actual amount of  damages resulting from such breach. Therefore, in the event of a violation of this provision, in  addition to any other right Provider may have at law or in equity, Client shall make a one-time  payment to Provider in the amount of one hundred percent (100%) of the affected employee\\'s  base salary for one year, which accurately reflects the reasonable value of the employee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time  and costs. We agree that such amount is not intended as a penalty and is reasonably calculated  based upon the projected costs the injured party would incur to identify, recruit, hire, and train  suitable replacements for such personnel.    DISPUTE RESOLUTION    Arbitration Procedures  Each party shall attempt to settle amicably by mutual discussions any disputes, differences, or  claims related to this Agreement within sixty (60) days of the date any such dispute arises.  Failing such amicable settlement, any such dispute, including claim related to the existence,  validity, interpretation, performance, termination, or breach of this Agreement, is to be settled by  arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association  (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAAA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). The arbitration will be conducted in English and will have one (1) arbitrator. The  Arbitrator will not have the authority to award punitive damages to either party. Each party will  bear its own expenses, but shall share equally the expenses of the Arbitration Tribunal and the  AAA. Any arbitration award will be final, and judgment thereon may be entered in any court of  competent jurisdiction.  The arbitration will be held in the city where Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s headquarters are  located, or at another location upon which the parties may agree. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  claims for preliminary injunctive relief, other pre-judgment remedies, and claims for Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  failure to pay for Services may be brought in a state or federal court in the United States with  jurisdiction over the subject matter and parties.

If Provider is  unable to resolve the dispute prior to the Payment Deadline, Client nevertheless shall pay the  entire invoiced amount by the Payment Deadline. If Provider ultimately determines that such\\'}{\\'page_number\\': 4, \\'content\\': \\'amount should not have been paid, Provider shall apply a credit equal to such amount against  any Service Fees owed for the following month.

TERM AND TERMINATION    Term  This Agreement commences on the Order Effective Date, and it will remain in effect until either  party terminates it as permitted below.    Month-to-Month Services  If the Order specifies no Initial Term with respect to any or all Services, then Provider will deliver  those Services on a month-to-month basis until one party provides written notice to the other  party of its intent to terminate those Services, in which case Provider will cease delivering those  Services at the end of the next calendar month following receipt of such written notice by the  other party.

Although it is under no obligation to do so, from time to time, Provider may make  recommendations regarding legal requirements and regulatory compliance protocols related to  Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s network and practices. If Client fails to adopt or implement the recommended legal  requirements or regulatory compliance protocols, Client is responsible for any and all damages  related to legal and regulatory compliance. Even if Client does take Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s advice regarding  legal requirements and regulatory compliance protocols, Provider does not take responsibility  for any legal requirements and regulatory compliance protocols or audits.    NO HIRING  Client shall not solicit for employment with Client any Provider employee with whom Client has  had direct contact in connection with the Services during the Term of this Agreement and for  twelve (12) months following termination of this Agreement.     Client acknowledges that injury resulting from any breach of this provision would be significant  and irreparable and that it would be extremely difficult to ascertain the actual amount of  damages resulting from such breach.

The arbitration will be conducted in English and will have one (1) arbitrator. The  Arbitrator will not have the authority to award punitive damages to either party. Each party will  bear its own expenses, but shall share equally the expenses of the Arbitration Tribunal and the  AAA. Any arbitration award will be final, and judgment thereon may be entered in any court of  competent jurisdiction.  The arbitration will be held in the city where Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s headquarters are  located, or at another location upon which the parties may agree.

The notice must be provided within thirty (30) days of the occurrence of the breach.\n\nThis can be inferred from Section 10.3 of the Master Service Agreement, which states that each party's indemnification rights require prompt notice of any claim against the party seeking to be indemnified. It further specifies that the party seeking to be indemnified must provide reasonable assistance in the defense or settlement of such claim.\n\nTherefore, in the context of this agreement, the client must provide notice within thirty (30) days when requesting indemnification from the service provider.\n\nTo reach this conclusion, I analyzed Section 10.3 of the Master Service Agreement, which specifically addresses indemnification by both parties.

If Client fails to adopt or implement the recommended legal  requirements or regulatory compliance protocols, Client is responsible for any and all damages  related to legal and regulatory compliance. Even if Client does take Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s advice regarding  legal requirements and regulatory compliance protocols, Provider does not take responsibility  for any legal requirements and regulatory compliance protocols or audits.    NO HIRING  Client shall not solicit for employment with Client any Provider employee with whom Client has  had direct contact in connection with the Services during the Term of this Agreement and for  twelve (12) months following termination of this Agreement.     Client acknowledges that injury resulting from any breach of this provision would be significant  and irreparable and that it would be extremely difficult to ascertain the actual amount of  damages resulting from such breach. Therefore, in the event of a violation of this provision, in  addition to any other right Provider may have at law or in equity, Client shall make a one-time  payment to Provider in the amount of one hundred percent (100%) of the affected employee\\'s  base salary for one year, which accurately reflects the reasonable value of the employee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time  and costs. We agree that such amount is not intended as a penalty and is reasonably calculated  based upon the projected costs the injured party would incur to identify, recruit, hire, and train  suitable replacements for such personnel.    DISPUTE RESOLUTION    Arbitration Procedures  Each party shall attempt to settle amicably by mutual discussions any disputes, differences, or  claims related to this Agreement within sixty (60) days of the date any such dispute arises.  Failing such amicable settlement, any such dispute, including claim related to the existence,  validity, interpretation, performance, termination, or breach of this Agreement, is to be settled by  arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association  (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAAA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). The arbitration will be conducted in English and will have one (1) arbitrator. The  Arbitrator will not have the authority to award punitive damages to either party. Each party will  bear its own expenses, but shall share equally the expenses of the Arbitration Tribunal and the  AAA. Any arbitration award will be final, and judgment thereon may be entered in any court of  competent jurisdiction.  The arbitration will be held in the city where Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s headquarters are  located, or at another location upon which the parties may agree. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  claims for preliminary injunctive relief, other pre-judgment remedies, and claims for Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  failure to pay for Services may be brought in a state or federal court in the United States with  jurisdiction over the subject matter and parties.    Period for Bringing Claim  No claims may be made more than six (6) months after the date by which the fault or failure  should reasonably have been discovered; failure to make such a claim within the six (6) month  period shall forever bar the claim.\"}{\\'page_number\\': 14, \\'content\\': \\'LIMITATION OF LIABILITY  EXCEPT AS MAY BE DESCRIBED IN AN APPLICABLE SCHEDULE OF SERVICES OR IN A  SERVICE AGREEMENT FOR PROJECT SERVICES, PROVIDER\\xe2\\x80\\x99S LIABILITY UNDER THIS  AGREEMENT IS LIMITED TO ANY ACTUAL, DIRECT DAMAGES INCURRED BY CLIENT  AND WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF (1) THE PROCEEDS OF PROVIDER\\xe2\\x80\\x99S  PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY INSURANCE MAINTAINED BY PROVIDER UNDER ITS  APPLICABLE INSURANCE POLICIES, OR (2) THE AMOUNTS PAID BY CLIENT TO  PROVIDER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL SERVICE DESCRIPTIONS IN THE  SCHEDULE OF SERVICES DURING THE SIX (6) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY  PRECEDING THE ACCRUAL OF ANY SUCH CLAIM.

According to this provision, the service provider may elect to raise the fees charged under the Order at any time after the parties sign the Order. If the increase in fees is greater than 10% annually, the service provider is required to give the customer no less than thirty (30) days' notice of the increase in fees to be charged.\n\nTherefore, the agreement requires the service provider to provide the customer with a minimum of thirty (30) days' notice in order to increase the price of the service, if the increase is greater than 10% annually.\n\nTo reach this conclusion, I analyzed the Master Service Agreement and specifically looked for any provisions related to price increases.

Pass-Through Expenses  Client shall pay Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including incremental third-party  service fees, travel expenses, lodging, meals, or other similar expenses, which may be incurred  by Provider in performing Services.

Payment Terms  Client shall pay the full amount reflected on any invoice as owed to Provider on the first (1st)  day of each month. Without waiving any of its other remedies, Provider reserves the right to  suspend services if payment is not received within thirty (30) days following Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s receipt of  that invoice. Client shall pay a late charge of one- and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the  maximum lawful rate, whichever is less, for all invoiced amounts not paid within thirty (30) days  following Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s receipt of that invoice (the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPayment Deadline\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).     If Client disputes in good faith all or any portion of the amount owed to us, or if Client otherwise  requests any adjustment to an invoiced amount, Client must notify Provider in writing, prior to  the Payment Deadline, of the nature and basis of the dispute and/or adjustment. If Provider is  unable to resolve the dispute prior to the Payment Deadline, Client nevertheless shall pay the  entire invoiced amount by the Payment Deadline. If Provider ultimately determines that such\\'}{\\'page_number\\': 4, \\'content\\': \\'amount should not have been paid, Provider shall apply a credit equal to such amount against  any Service Fees owed for the following month.    Special rates may apply for services requested outside of normal business hours or on holidays.  Special rates are one-and-one-half (1.5) times normal hourly rates, with a one-hour minimum.  Holiday hour rates are two (2) times normal hourly rates, with a one-hour minimum.    Suspension of Service  If Client fails to pay all amounts owed under this Agreement when due, then upon at least ten  (10) business days\\xe2\\x80\\x99 prior written notice, and in addition to any other remedies available to  Provider, Provider may suspend Services and withhold Confidential Information (defined below)  under this Agreement until full payment is made. Following any suspension of service under this  provision, and after Client makes full payment to Provider, Provider may restore the Services  after validating that all components to be monitored and/or managed under any applicable  Order or Service Attachment comply with Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s level of security, updates, and best  practices. Client shall pay a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReactivation Fee\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for such restoration equal to one month of the  Service Fees. Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right to suspend Services under this section is in addition to Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  right to terminate this Agreement.    Taxes  Unless otherwise indicated on an invoice, all charges and fees owed under this Agreement are  exclusive of any applicable sales, use, excise, or services taxes that may be assessed on the  provision of the Services. In the event that any taxes are assessed on the provision of any of the  Services, Client shall pay the taxes directly to the taxing authority or shall reimburse Provider for  their payment.    TERM AND TERMINATION    Term  This Agreement commences on the Order Effective Date, and it will remain in effect until either  party terminates it as permitted below.    Month-to-Month Services  If the Order specifies no Initial Term with respect to any or all Services, then Provider will deliver  those Services on a month-to-month basis until one party provides written notice to the other  party of its intent to terminate those Services, in which case Provider will cease delivering those  Services at the end of the next calendar month following receipt of such written notice by the  other party.    Trial Period  Provider offers a trial period for a limited number of Services.  If a trial period is included in the  Order, Client may cancel during the trial period without paying a termination fee for those  Services. To cancel during the trial period, Client must provide thirty (30) days\\xe2\\x80\\x99 written notice  and pay all Service Fees due up to the date of termination.    Termination  Either party may terminate this MSA for any reason or no reason upon at least thirty (30) days  advance, written notice given to the other party. However, termination of this MSA will not, by  itself, result in the termination of any Order or Service Attachments, and this MSA will remain in  effect notwithstanding any notice of termination unless and until all Orders and/or Service  Attachments are terminated or expire according to their terms.\\'}{\\'page_number\\': 13, \\'content\\': \"COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS  Provider shall comply with all laws applicable to Provider in its role as a Managed IT Provider.

We agree that such amount is not intended as a penalty and is reasonably calculated  based upon the projected costs the injured party would incur to identify, recruit, hire, and train  suitable replacements for such personnel.

{"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the provided Master Service Agreement, there is a limitation of liability clause included. The clause is mentioned on page 14 of the agreement. \n\nThe clause states that Provider's liability under this Agreement is limited to any actual, direct damages incurred by the Client and will not exceed the greater of (1) the proceeds of Provider's professional liability insurance maintained by Provider under its applicable insurance policies, or (2) the amounts paid by the Client to Provider under this Agreement and all service descriptions in the Schedule of Services during the six (6) month period immediately preceding the accrual of any such claim.\n\nIn simpler terms, this means that the liability of the Provider is limited to either the amount covered by their professional liability insurance or the total amount paid by the Client to the Provider in the six months prior to the claim, whichever is greater.\n\nTo reach this conclusion, I analyzed the Master Service Agreement and specifically looked for a clause related to limitation of liability. After reviewing the content on each page, I found the clause on page 14 that clearly addresses the limitation of liability and specifies the amount to which liability is limited.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Master Service Agreement, the liability is limited to the greater of the proceeds of Provider's professional liability insurance or the amounts paid by the Client to the Provider in the six months prior to the claim."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the analysis of the Master Service Agreement, it can be concluded that the contract does allow for termination for material breach. \n\nThe termination clause in the agreement states that either party may terminate the MSA for any reason or no reason upon at least thirty (30) days advance written notice given to the other party. This means that if one party breaches a material term or condition of the MSA, the other party has the right to terminate the agreement by providing written notice.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the party seeking termination must provide notice of the breach and a reasonable opportunity for the breaching party to remedy the breach. This means that the party seeking termination must give the breaching party a chance to rectify the breach before terminating the agreement.\n\nIn conclusion, the Master Service Agreement does allow for termination for material breach, but the party seeking termination must follow the proper procedure of providing notice and allowing the breaching party an opportunity to remedy the breach."}

Client accepts these Terms by signing an Order, using the services, or  continuing to use the services after being notified of a change to these Terms.  If there is a  conflict between the Order, this Master Services Agreement, any Service Attachment, or  Exhibit, the Order will control.  The parties agree as follows:  STATEMENT OF SERVICES  Service Attachments  The services to be delivered by Provider (the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cServices\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) and the fees for those Services, and  the specific terms applicable to those Services are described in the Order or in one or more  Service Attachments referencing this Agreement.  Except for Supplemental Services or Project Services (described below), and unless otherwise  agreed in writing, the services Provider will deliver to Client are limited to those Services  specifically identified in the Order and described in the Service Attachments or Schedule of  Services. In the event of any conflict between the terms of a Service Attachment or Schedule of  Services and this Agreement, the terms in the Service Attachment or Schedule of Services  control.  In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and of an Order and  any Service Attachment or Schedule of Services, the terms of the Order control.

NO HIRING  Client shall not solicit for employment with Client any Provider employee with whom Client has  had direct contact in connection with the Services during the Term of this Agreement and for  twelve (12) months following termination of this Agreement.     Client acknowledges that injury resulting from any breach of this provision would be significant  and irreparable and that it would be extremely difficult to ascertain the actual amount of  damages resulting from such breach. Therefore, in the event of a violation of this provision, in  addition to any other right Provider may have at law or in equity, Client shall make a one-time  payment to Provider in the amount of one hundred percent (100%) of the affected employee\\'s  base salary for one year, which accurately reflects the reasonable value of the employee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time  and costs.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION    Arbitration Procedures  Each party shall attempt to settle amicably by mutual discussions any disputes, differences, or  claims related to this Agreement within sixty (60) days of the date any such dispute arises.  Failing such amicable settlement, any such dispute, including claim related to the existence,  validity, interpretation, performance, termination, or breach of this Agreement, is to be settled by  arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association  (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAAA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).

Each party will  bear its own expenses, but shall share equally the expenses of the Arbitration Tribunal and the  AAA. Any arbitration award will be final, and judgment thereon may be entered in any court of  competent jurisdiction.  The arbitration will be held in the city where Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s headquarters are  located, or at another location upon which the parties may agree.

The breaching party then has thirty (30) days from receipt of the notice to cure the breach.\n\nTherefore, according to the Master Service Agreement, the customer has thirty (30) days to cure a material breach if provided with an opportunity to do so.\n\nTo reach this conclusion, I analyzed the relevant section of the agreement and identified the specific timeframe mentioned for curing a material breach.

{"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on my analysis of the Master Service Agreement, the answer to the question \"Does the agreement include a provision for increasing the price of the services?\" is yes. \n\nOn page 2 of the agreement, under the section titled \"FEES FOR SERVICES | PAYMENT TERMS,\" it states that the fees for services are set forth in the Order or Statement of Work. It further mentions that unless otherwise indicated in writing, all services will be performed on a time-and-materials basis at the provider's then-current rates. \n\nAdditionally, the agreement specifies that adjustments to service fees can be made under certain circumstances. For example, if the number of users or devices in the client's environment exceeds the numbers previously ordered, the provider may apply a pro rata adjustment to the total service fees. Similarly, if the number of users or devices is less than the numbers previously ordered, the provider will apply a pro rata adjustment upon request. \n\nFurthermore, the agreement allows the provider to elect to raise the fees charged under an order at any time. If the increase is greater than 10% annually, the provider must give the client at least thirty (30) days' notice. The client then has the option to terminate the order without incurring any additional charges or penalties. \n\nBased on these provisions, it is clear that the agreement includes provisions for increasing the price of the services."}

Taxes  Unless otherwise indicated on an invoice, all charges and fees owed under this Agreement are  exclusive of any applicable sales, use, excise, or services taxes that may be assessed on the  provision of the Services. In the event that any taxes are assessed on the provision of any of the  Services, Client shall pay the taxes directly to the taxing authority or shall reimburse Provider for  their payment.    TERM AND TERMINATION    Term  This Agreement commences on the Order Effective Date, and it will remain in effect until either  party terminates it as permitted below.    Month-to-Month Services  If the Order specifies no Initial Term with respect to any or all Services, then Provider will deliver  those Services on a month-to-month basis until one party provides written notice to the other  party of its intent to terminate those Services, in which case Provider will cease delivering those  Services at the end of the next calendar month following receipt of such written notice by the  other party.    Trial Period  Provider offers a trial period for a limited number of Services.  If a trial period is included in the  Order, Client may cancel during the trial period without paying a termination fee for those  Services. To cancel during the trial period, Client must provide thirty (30) days\\xe2\\x80\\x99 written notice  and pay all Service Fees due up to the date of termination.    Termination  Either party may terminate this MSA for any reason or no reason upon at least thirty (30) days  advance, written notice given to the other party. However, termination of this MSA will not, by  itself, result in the termination of any Order or Service Attachments, and this MSA will remain in  effect notwithstanding any notice of termination unless and until all Orders and/or Service  Attachments are terminated or expire according to their terms.\\'}{\\'page_number\\': 5, \\'content\\': \\'\\xc2\\xa9 Scott & Scott, LLP        INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR  Unless otherwise agreed, Provider will perform all Services solely as an independent contractor  and not as an employee, agent, or representative of Client.

Client further hereby irrevocably assigns to Provider all of its patent, copyright,  trade secret, know-how, and other proprietary and associated rights in any Provider Work.    License to Provider Works  If any Provider Work is located on hardware or equipment owned by Client, Provider hereby  grants Client a perpetual, non-exclusive, revocable, royalty-free license to use any Provider  Work during the term of this Agreement (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLimited License\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).  The Limited License will be  immediately and automatically revoked without the need for notice in the event that either party  terminates the Services or this Agreement. Additional license restrictions may be set forth in the Service Attachments.    Improvements to Services    Client hereby assigns to Provider any and all suggestions, ideas, enhancement requests,  feedback, recommendations, or other information provided by Client or Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s users relating to  any proposed improvements of or modifications to the Services.

For the avoidance of doubt, unless otherwise provided in a separate Data Processing  Agreement (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDPA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), Provider is not responsible for complying with the laws applicable to Client  or Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s industry. Client shall comply with all laws applicable to Client or in Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s industry.    Although it is under no obligation to do so, from time to time, Provider may make  recommendations regarding legal requirements and regulatory compliance protocols related to  Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s network and practices. If Client fails to adopt or implement the recommended legal  requirements or regulatory compliance protocols, Client is responsible for any and all damages  related to legal and regulatory compliance. Even if Client does take Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s advice regarding  legal requirements and regulatory compliance protocols, Provider does not take responsibility  for any legal requirements and regulatory compliance protocols or audits.    NO HIRING  Client shall not solicit for employment with Client any Provider employee with whom Client has  had direct contact in connection with the Services during the Term of this Agreement and for  twelve (12) months following termination of this Agreement.     Client acknowledges that injury resulting from any breach of this provision would be significant  and irreparable and that it would be extremely difficult to ascertain the actual amount of  damages resulting from such breach. Therefore, in the event of a violation of this provision, in  addition to any other right Provider may have at law or in equity, Client shall make a one-time  payment to Provider in the amount of one hundred percent (100%) of the affected employee\\'s  base salary for one year, which accurately reflects the reasonable value of the employee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time  and costs. We agree that such amount is not intended as a penalty and is reasonably calculated  based upon the projected costs the injured party would incur to identify, recruit, hire, and train  suitable replacements for such personnel.    DISPUTE RESOLUTION    Arbitration Procedures  Each party shall attempt to settle amicably by mutual discussions any disputes, differences, or  claims related to this Agreement within sixty (60) days of the date any such dispute arises.  Failing such amicable settlement, any such dispute, including claim related to the existence,  validity, interpretation, performance, termination, or breach of this Agreement, is to be settled by  arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association  (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAAA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). The arbitration will be conducted in English and will have one (1) arbitrator. The  Arbitrator will not have the authority to award punitive damages to either party. Each party will  bear its own expenses, but shall share equally the expenses of the Arbitration Tribunal and the  AAA. Any arbitration award will be final, and judgment thereon may be entered in any court of  competent jurisdiction.  The arbitration will be held in the city where Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s headquarters are  located, or at another location upon which the parties may agree. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  claims for preliminary injunctive relief, other pre-judgment remedies, and claims for Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  failure to pay for Services may be brought in a state or federal court in the United States with  jurisdiction over the subject matter and parties.    Period for Bringing Claim  No claims may be made more than six (6) months after the date by which the fault or failure  should reasonably have been discovered; failure to make such a claim within the six (6) month  period shall forever bar the claim.\"}{\\'page_number\\': 14, \\'content\\': \\'LIMITATION OF LIABILITY  EXCEPT AS MAY BE DESCRIBED IN AN APPLICABLE SCHEDULE OF SERVICES OR IN A  SERVICE AGREEMENT FOR PROJECT SERVICES, PROVIDER\\xe2\\x80\\x99S LIABILITY UNDER THIS  AGREEMENT IS LIMITED TO ANY ACTUAL, DIRECT DAMAGES INCURRED BY CLIENT  AND WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF (1) THE PROCEEDS OF PROVIDER\\xe2\\x80\\x99S  PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY INSURANCE MAINTAINED BY PROVIDER UNDER ITS  APPLICABLE INSURANCE POLICIES, OR (2) THE AMOUNTS PAID BY CLIENT TO  PROVIDER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL SERVICE DESCRIPTIONS IN THE  SCHEDULE OF SERVICES DURING THE SIX (6) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY  PRECEDING THE ACCRUAL OF ANY SUCH CLAIM.

This includes loss of profits, loss of business, loss of opportunity, loss or corruption of data, regardless of the form of action, whether contractual or non-contractual.\n\nFurthermore, the clause specifies that each party's liability to the other under the agreement, for damages, losses, or liability for any cause whatsoever, shall be limited to a maximum of the fees paid and owed for the SaaS provided to the customer during the twelve (12) months preceding the claim.

Similarly, during the term of an Order, if the number of users or devices in Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  environment or the Service or Equipment types or quantities to be covered within the  scope of the Order is less than the numbers, types or quantities previously ordered,  upon request, Provider will apply a pro rata adjustment to the total Service Fees. You  shall pay all Service Fees owed as they become due following any such adjustment.  However, under no circumstances may any such adjustments result in a number of  users or devices in Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s environment or in any Service or Equipment types or  quantities to be covered within the scope of the Order that is less than the numbers,  types or quantities ordered at the time Client signed that Order.     \"User\" means Client\\\\\\'s employees, consultants, contractors or agents who are authorized  to use the Service and have been supplied user identifications and passwords by Client  (or by Provider upon Client\\\\\\'s request). Users do not include any customers of Client or  other third parties.     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDevice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d means any equipment included in the Services, whether owned by Client or  provided by Provider for Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s use, including, but not limited to computers, printers,  servers, routers, and mobile or handheld microcomputers as well as the software  necessary to operate such equipment.\\'}{\\'page_number\\': 3, \\'content\\': \\'\\xc2\\xa9 Scott & Scott, LLP      Service Fees owed as they become due following any such adjustment.    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Service Fee Rate Increases. At any time after the parties sign an Order, Provider may  elect to raise the fees that it charges under that Order.  If the increase is greater than  10% annually, Provider shall give Client no less than thirty (30) days\\xe2\\x80\\x99 notice of any such  increase in fees to be charged. Following Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s receipt of such notice, Client may  terminate the Order without incurring any additional charges or penalties, if any, that  Client ordinarily would incur for such termination.    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Third-Party Services. Client understands and agrees that Provider uses third-party  solutions and service providers to perform some or all of the managed services offered  to Client (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThird-Party Service Providers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).  PROVIDER IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR  THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS.  CLIENT\\xe2\\x80\\x99S  RIGHTS REGARDING CLAIMS AGAINST THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS  SHALL BE GOVERNED BY SUCH SERVICE PROVIDER\\xe2\\x80\\x99S END USER LICENSE  AGREEMENT OR TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s current Third-Party Service  providers and the governing terms and conditions related to those services are listed on  the Schedule of Third-Party Services which may be updated by Provider without further  notice to Client and is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth in this Agreement.      \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Off-Boarding. Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cancellation, termination, or transition of the Services to Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  control or to another service provider (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOff-Boarding\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) may trigger a billable project.  Any  Off-Boarding projects will be subject to a separate Order or Project Service Attachment  or Statement of Work, which will be billed at Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s then-prevailing rates.    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Client Delay.  If Provider is unable to commence delivery of the Services on the service  start date because of any failure on Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s part including but not limited to the failure to  provide access to Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s resources in a timely manner, Client nonetheless will begin to  incur Service Fees, which Client shall pay in accordance with the Order, the Service  Attachment and the Master Services Agreement. Pass-Through Expenses  Client shall pay Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including incremental third-party  service fees, travel expenses, lodging, meals, or other similar expenses, which may be incurred  by Provider in performing Services. Any such \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPass-Through Expenses\\xe2\\x80\\x9d will be billed at cost  and invoiced monthly.    Payment Terms  Client shall pay the full amount reflected on any invoice as owed to Provider on the first (1st)  day of each month. Without waiving any of its other remedies, Provider reserves the right to  suspend services if payment is not received within thirty (30) days following Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s receipt of  that invoice. Client shall pay a late charge of one- and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the  maximum lawful rate, whichever is less, for all invoiced amounts not paid within thirty (30) days  following Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s receipt of that invoice (the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPayment Deadline\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).     If Client disputes in good faith all or any portion of the amount owed to us, or if Client otherwise  requests any adjustment to an invoiced amount, Client must notify Provider in writing, prior to  the Payment Deadline, of the nature and basis of the dispute and/or adjustment. If Provider is  unable to resolve the dispute prior to the Payment Deadline, Client nevertheless shall pay the  entire invoiced amount by the Payment Deadline. If Provider ultimately determines that such\\'}{\\'page_number\\': 4, \\'content\\': \\'amount should not have been paid, Provider shall apply a credit equal to such amount against  any Service Fees owed for the following month.    Special rates may apply for services requested outside of normal business hours or on holidays.  Special rates are one-and-one-half (1.5) times normal hourly rates, with a one-hour minimum.  Holiday hour rates are two (2) times normal hourly rates, with a one-hour minimum.    Suspension of Service  If Client fails to pay all amounts owed under this Agreement when due, then upon at least ten  (10) business days\\xe2\\x80\\x99 prior written notice, and in addition to any other remedies available to  Provider, Provider may suspend Services and withhold Confidential Information (defined below)  under this Agreement until full payment is made. Following any suspension of service under this  provision, and after Client makes full payment to Provider, Provider may restore the Services  after validating that all components to be monitored and/or managed under any applicable  Order or Service Attachment comply with Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s level of security, updates, and best  practices. Client shall pay a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReactivation Fee\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for such restoration equal to one month of the  Service Fees. Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right to suspend Services under this section is in addition to Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  right to terminate this Agreement.    Taxes  Unless otherwise indicated on an invoice, all charges and fees owed under this Agreement are  exclusive of any applicable sales, use, excise, or services taxes that may be assessed on the  provision of the Services. In the event that any taxes are assessed on the provision of any of the  Services, Client shall pay the taxes directly to the taxing authority or shall reimburse Provider for  their payment.    TERM AND TERMINATION    Term  This Agreement commences on the Order Effective Date, and it will remain in effect until either  party terminates it as permitted below.    Month-to-Month Services  If the Order specifies no Initial Term with respect to any or all Services, then Provider will deliver  those Services on a month-to-month basis until one party provides written notice to the other  party of its intent to terminate those Services, in which case Provider will cease delivering those  Services at the end of the next calendar month following receipt of such written notice by the  other party.    Trial Period  Provider offers a trial period for a limited number of Services.  If a trial period is included in the  Order, Client may cancel during the trial period without paying a termination fee for those  Services. To cancel during the trial period, Client must provide thirty (30) days\\xe2\\x80\\x99 written notice  and pay all Service Fees due up to the date of termination.    Termination  Either party may terminate this MSA for any reason or no reason upon at least thirty (30) days  advance, written notice given to the other party. However, termination of this MSA will not, by  itself, result in the termination of any Order or Service Attachments, and this MSA will remain in  effect notwithstanding any notice of termination unless and until all Orders and/or Service  Attachments are terminated or expire according to their terms.\\'}{\\'page_number\\': 5, \\'content\\': \\'\\xc2\\xa9 Scott & Scott, LLP        INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR  Unless otherwise agreed, Provider will perform all Services solely as an independent contractor  and not as an employee, agent, or representative of Client.

The Limited License will be  immediately and automatically revoked without the need for notice in the event that either party  terminates the Services or this Agreement.\\'}{\\'page_number\\': 13, \\'content\\': \"COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS  Provider shall comply with all laws applicable to Provider in its role as a Managed IT Provider.  For the avoidance of doubt, unless otherwise provided in a separate Data Processing  Agreement (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDPA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), Provider is not responsible for complying with the laws applicable to Client  or Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s industry. Client shall comply with all laws applicable to Client or in Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s industry.    Although it is under no obligation to do so, from time to time, Provider may make  recommendations regarding legal requirements and regulatory compliance protocols related to  Client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s network and practices.

NO HIRING  Client shall not solicit for employment with Client any Provider employee with whom Client has  had direct contact in connection with the Services during the Term of this Agreement and for  twelve (12) months following termination of this Agreement.     Client acknowledges that injury resulting from any breach of this provision would be significant  and irreparable and that it would be extremely difficult to ascertain the actual amount of  damages resulting from such breach. Therefore, in the event of a violation of this provision, in  addition to any other right Provider may have at law or in equity, Client shall make a one-time  payment to Provider in the amount of one hundred percent (100%) of the affected employee\\'s  base salary for one year, which accurately reflects the reasonable value of the employee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time  and costs.

The arbitration will be conducted in English and will have one (1) arbitrator. The  Arbitrator will not have the authority to award punitive damages to either party. Each party will  bear its own expenses, but shall share equally the expenses of the Arbitration Tribunal and the  AAA. Any arbitration award will be final, and judgment thereon may be entered in any court of  competent jurisdiction.  The arbitration will be held in the city where Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s headquarters are  located, or at another location upon which the parties may agree.

If Client transfers its rights, interests, and obligations under this Agreement  without Provider consent, then such assignment will not be valid, and Client shall remain  responsible for all Fees under this Agreement and any Attachment regardless of whether Client  continues to derive any benefit from the Services. In addition, unless otherwise agreed, Provider  may contract with third parties to deliver some or all of the Services, and no such third-party  contract is to be interpreted as an assignment of this Agreement. However, Provider will use  commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any and all such third parties abide by all of the  terms of this Agreement, and, except as otherwise agreed, Provider will remain solely  responsible for the fulfillment of all of Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s obligations under this Agreement.

{"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the provided Master Service Agreement, the contract does allow for termination for material breach. \n\nClause 8.1 of the Agreement states that either party may terminate the Agreement for material breach by the other party. However, there are certain conditions that need to be met for termination to occur. The non-breaching party must notify the breaching party in writing of the breach within thirty (30) days of its occurrence. The breaching party then has thirty (30) days to cure the breach after receiving the notice. If the breach is not cured within the specified time frame, the non-breaching party has the right to terminate the Agreement.\n\nThis clause indicates that termination for material breach is allowed, but it also emphasizes the importance of providing notice and allowing the breaching party an opportunity to remedy the breach. This aligns with the general principle mentioned in the instructions that termination for breach usually requires notice and a reasonable opportunity for the breaching party to remedy the breach.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided Master Service Agreement, the contract does allow for termination for material breach, subject to the conditions outlined in Clause 8.1."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " 30 days\n\nThe question asks for the amount of notice required by the service provider to give to the customer before increasing the price of the service. To find the answer, I analyzed the provided Master Service Agreement (MSA) content for any clauses that discuss changes in service fees or price adjustments.\n\nUpon reviewing the content, I found the relevant provision on 'page_number': 6, under the section titled '4. Services Fees; Taxes'. Specifically, 'content': '4.1 Services Fees. The Fees are stated on the Stripe Pricing Page, unless you and Stripe otherwise agree in writing. Stripe may revise the Fees at any time. If Stripe revises the Fees for a Service that you are currently using, Stripe will notify you at least 30 days before the revised Fees apply to you.'\n\nThis clause clearly states that if there is a revision in the fees for a service currently being used by the customer, the service provider (in this case, Stripe) is obligated to notify the customer at least 30 days before the revised fees take effect. Therefore, the MSA requires a 30-day notice period for the service provider to increase the price of the service.\n\nThe thought process involved identifying the section of the MSA that pertains to service fees, as this would logically be where any provisions regarding price increases would be found. Upon locating the relevant section, it was a matter of reading the specific language used to determine the required notice period. The term \"revised Fees\" in the context of the agreement refers to an increase in prices, which aligns with the core meaning of the question."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes\n\nThe Master Service Agreement (MSA) does provide for automatic renewal of the services. This is explicitly stated in the content provided from page 5 of the MSA, which reads: \"The contract renews automatically after 6 months.\" This clause indicates that upon the expiration of the initial term set forth on the Sales Order, the contract will renew itself for another term unless earlier terminated by either party in accordance with the termination provisions of the agreement.\n\nThe thought process behind this answer involves identifying the key term \"automatic renewal\" from the question and locating any relevant provisions within the MSA that address the renewal of services. The term \"automatic renewal\" typically refers to a contractual clause that allows for the continuation of services or the extension of a contract term without the need for manual re-signing or express consent from the parties at the time of renewal. In this case, the MSA explicitly states that the contract renews automatically, which directly answers the question posed.\n\nIt is important to note that the automatic renewal clause is subject to any rights of termination that the parties may have under the agreement. The MSA also outlines the circumstances under which either party may terminate the agreement, such as material breach that remains uncured, as mentioned in the termination subsection on page 5. However, in the absence of such termination, the services will renew automatically as per the terms of the MSA."}

Additionally, on page 39, the agreement uses the terms \"We,\" \"Us,\" \"Our,\" or \"Celonis\" to refer to the Celonis entity entering into the applicable order with the customer.

{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes\n\nThe Master Service Agreement (MSA) provided includes an indemnification clause under which the customer indemnifies the service provider. This is evident from the content on page 14 and page 15 of the MSA.\n\nOn page 14, under section 11.2 titled \"User Indemnification,\" it states, \"You will defend the Stripe Parties against any Claim made against any of the Stripe Parties to the extent arising out of or relating to: (i) your breach of any of your representations, warranties or obligations under this Agreement; (ii) your use of the Services, including use of Personal Data; (iii) an allegation that any of the Marks you license to Stripe, or your Content, infringes on or misappropriates the rights, including IP Rights, of the third party making the Claim; or (iv) a User Party\u2019s negligence, willful misconduct or fraud.\"\n\nFurthermore, on page 15, under the same section (11.2), it continues with \"(b) Indemnification. You will indemnify the Stripe Parties against all Stripe Losses arising out of or relating to Claims described in this Section 11.2.\"\n\nThe language used in these sections clearly indicates that the customer (referred to as \"You\") is required to defend and indemnify the service provider (referred to as \"Stripe Parties\") against certain types of claims and losses. This obligation includes claims arising from the customer's breach of the agreement, use of the services, infringement claims related to the customer's content or marks, and the customer's negligence or misconduct.\n\nThe indemnification clause is a common provision in MSAs that allocates risk between the parties. In this case, the customer is taking on the responsibility to protect the service provider from certain legal claims and associated losses, which is a form of indemnification.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis of the relevant sections of the MSA, the answer to whether the MSA includes an indemnification clause under which the customer indemnifies the service provider is \"yes.\""}

If so then What are the intellectual property rights for customer in this agreement?'''"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes, the MSA does include provisions regarding the intellectual property rights owned by the customer. The relevant sections of the MSA that address intellectual property rights, specifically those owned by the customer, are as follows:\n\n1. Section 1.8 defines \"Customer Content\" as any content that is uploaded onto the Services by Customer or otherwise used on or in connection with the Software. This implies that the customer retains ownership of the content they contribute to the services.\n\n2. Section 3.2 states that the Services (excluding the Customer Content and Integration Partners data hosted thereon), Software, and all other materials provided by Expel, including all Intellectual Property Rights in each of the foregoing, are the exclusive property of Expel. This explicitly excludes Customer Content from the materials that Expel claims ownership over, thereby recognizing the customer's ownership of their intellectual property.\n\n3. Section 3.3 provides that Expel will create and make available to Customer security incident and other related reports (\"Reports\"). While the Report template and related Intellectual Property Rights remain the property of Expel, this does not extend to the Customer Content within those reports, which would be owned by the customer.\n\n4. Section 5.3 further emphasizes the customer's responsibility for the Customer Content, including all changes to and/or deletions of Customer Content and the security of all passwords and other Access Protocols required to access the Services. This responsibility implies ownership and control over the intellectual property rights of the Customer Content.\n\nFrom these sections, it can be inferred that the intellectual property rights for the customer in this agreement pertain to the \"Customer Content\" they upload or use in connection with the Software. The customer retains ownership of this content, and Expel recognizes this ownership by excluding Customer Content from the materials over which Expel claims exclusive rights.\n\nThe thought process involved in generating this answer included identifying the relevant sections of the MSA that discuss intellectual property rights, understanding the distinction made between Expel's property and Customer Content, and recognizing the implications of the customer's responsibilities for their content as outlined in the agreement. The core meaning of the question was to determine whether the customer's intellectual property rights were acknowledged and protected under the MSA, and the analysis of the agreement's content confirms that they are."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes, the MSA does include a limitation of liability clause. The relevant content is found on page 5 and page 6 of the Master Service Agreement.\n\nThe clause on page 5 under section 8.5 states that, except in connection with a party's gross negligence or willful misconduct, indemnity obligations, violation of representations or warranties, or confidentiality obligations, neither party will be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages arising from or relating to the agreement.\n\nFurther clarification on the specific amount to which liability is limited is provided on page 6, where it states that the aggregate liability of either party arising out of or related to the agreement shall not exceed the total amount paid or payable by the client under the order giving rise to the liability in the twelve (12) months preceding the first incident out of which the liability arose.\n\nTo synthesize the information from the agreement, the limitation of liability clause is designed to cap the financial responsibility of either party to the total amount paid or payable under the specific order that is the subject of the claim, and this is limited to the payments made in the twelve months prior to the incident that gave rise to the liability. This effectively limits the potential financial exposure of the parties under the agreement, providing a predictable and quantifiable risk for both parties involved."}

Please provide a precise \"yes\" or \"no\" answer if possible.'''"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes\n\nThe Master Service Agreement (MSA) specifically requires the service provider to delete customer data upon termination of the MSA. This is explicitly stated in the content provided from page 9, which reads: \"X.5. Return of Customer Data For a period of 7 days after termination of this MSA, Customer Data remains stored in the Application Services. At the conclusion of the 7-day period, Adverity shall delete the Customer Data from the Application Services and shall destroy any corresponding documents under its control, except to the extent that Adverity is bound by law to continue storing such Customer Data.\"\n\nThe question asks whether the MSA requires the service provider to delete customer data upon request by the customer or upon termination of the MSA. The provided text from the MSA addresses the scenario of termination, ensuring that the service provider is obligated to delete the customer data after a specific period following the termination of the agreement. However, the text does not explicitly mention the deletion of data upon request by the customer outside the context of termination.\n\nMy thought process involved looking for terms related to \"customer data,\" \"deletion,\" \"termination,\" and \"request by customer\" within the provided content. The relevant section was found in the content from page 9, which directly addresses the obligation of the service provider to delete customer data upon termination. The absence of any mention of a requirement to delete data upon customer request outside of termination suggests that the MSA does not explicitly provide for such a scenario. However, the question's core meaning focuses on the deletion of data in relation to the termination of the MSA, to which the answer is clearly stated in the agreement."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes\n\nThe Master Service Agreement (MSA) does require the service provider to delete customer data upon request by the customer or upon termination of the MSA. This is evidenced by the content provided on page 9, which states, \"Except to the extent required otherwise by Data Privacy Laws, PSP will, at the choice of Client, return to Client and/or securely destroy all Personal Data.\" This clause indicates that the service provider, referred to as PSP, is obligated to either return or destroy all Personal Data belonging to the client, based on the client's preference, unless there is a legal requirement that dictates otherwise.\n\nFurthermore, the agreement specifies that the deletion of the Client Personal Data shall also include deletion of backups and logs in which information could be contained. This is a clear indication that the service provider must not only delete the primary data sets but also any ancillary records that may contain the client's personal data.\n\nThe MSA also mentions that the service provider will inform the client if it is not able to return or delete the Personal Data, which implies that the default expectation is for the data to be returned or deleted unless prohibited by Data Privacy Laws.\n\nThe analysis of the agreement requires understanding the terms used and their implications. The term \"Personal Data\" is key here, and the agreement outlines specific actions regarding this data upon the termination of the agreement or at the client's request. The term \"PSP\" refers to the service provider, and the term \"Client\" refers to the customer. The agreement's language around data deletion is clear and provides for the deletion of data, including backups and logs, which is a comprehensive approach to data destruction.\n\nIn conclusion, the MSA does require the service provider to delete customer data upon request by the customer or upon termination of the MSA, subject to any overriding legal requirements."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " The name of the customer is \"New Age XYZ tech.\"\n\nIn the context of the Master Service Agreement (MSA), the term \"customer\" refers to the entity that is receiving the services provided under the agreement. The question asks for the name of this entity.\n\nTo find the answer, I analyzed the provided JSON-formatted MSA content, looking for any mention of the customer's name. The key piece of information is found on the last provided page of the MSA content, page number 1, where it states: \"MASTER SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT (\u201cMSA\u201d) THIS MASTER SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT (\u201cMSA\u201d) (in the version dated January 23, 2023) GOVERNS THE USE BY ANY PERSON OR ENTITY (\u201cCUSTOMER\u201d) OF THE APPLICATION SERVICES (AS DEFINED BELOW) PROVIDED BY ADVERITY INC. (\u201cADVERITY\u201d). BY ENTERING A COMMERCIAL AGREEMENT (AS DEFINED BELOW) THAT REFERENCES THIS MSA, CUSTOMER AGREES TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS MSA. Customer 'New Age XYZ tech' and Adverity.\"\n\nThis excerpt clearly identifies \"New Age XYZ tech\" as the customer, which is the entity to which the services will be provided by Adverity Inc. The use of the term \"Customer\" followed by the name in single quotes indicates the specific party to the agreement, distinguishing it from the service provider, Adverity Inc.\n\nIt is important to note that the name of the customer is not always explicitly stated in the body of the agreement but can be found in the definitions or in the introductory clauses, as it was in this case. The introductory clause often serves to identify the parties to the agreement, which is why it was crucial to review the entire document carefully, including the beginning and end of the agreement, to locate the customer's name."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " The name of the service provider in this agreement is \"Adverity Inc.\"\n\nIn the context of a Master Service Agreement (MSA), the term \"service provider\" refers to the party that is providing the services outlined in the agreement. The question asks for the name of the service provider in the agreement provided.\n\nTo determine the service provider's name, I analyzed the content of the MSA provided in JSON format. The term \"service provider\" is synonymous with terms such as \"Seller,\" \"Vendor,\" or \"Supplier\" in various contractual agreements. In this MSA, the term \"Adverity\" is mentioned multiple times in conjunction with the provision of services. For example, on page 1, the agreement states, \"THIS MASTER SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT (\u201cMSA\u201d) (in the version dated January 23, 2023) GOVERNS THE USE BY ANY PERSON OR ENTITY (\u201cCUSTOMER\u201d) OF THE APPLICATION SERVICES (AS DEFINED BELOW) PROVIDED BY ADVERITY INC. (\u201cADVERITY\u201d).\" This clearly identifies Adverity Inc. as the party providing the application services, which is the subject of the MSA.\n\nAdditionally, throughout the agreement, there are references to \"Customer\" and \"Adverity,\" indicating the two parties involved, with Adverity being the one providing the services. For instance, on page 2, it states, \"Adverity shall make the Application Services available to Customer pursuant to this MSA,\" further confirming that Adverity Inc. is the service provider.\n\nTherefore, by understanding the context and the way the agreement is structured, it is clear that the service provider referred to in the MSA is Adverity Inc."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes\n\nThe Master Service Agreement (MSA) does include an indemnification clause under which the customer indemnifies the service provider. This is evident from the content provided on page 8, which states:\n\n\"VIII.2. Indemnification by Customer Customer shall defend Adverity against any claim, demand, suit or proceeding made or brought against Adverity by a third party alleging that Customer Data, or Customer\u2019s use of the Application Services in breach of this MSA, infringes or misappropriates such third party\u2019s intellectual property rights or arises from Customer\u2019s breach of the terms of this MSA.\"\n\nThis clause clearly indicates that the customer is required to defend and potentially indemnify the service provider, Adverity, against third-party claims that arise from the customer's data or use of the application services in a way that infringes on intellectual property rights or results from the customer's breach of the MSA terms.\n\nThe indemnification clause is a common provision in MSAs that outlines the obligation of one party to compensate the other for certain types of losses and liabilities. In this case, the indemnification is one-sided, with the customer having the obligation to indemnify the service provider. There is no mention in the provided excerpts of the MSA of a reciprocal indemnification obligation on the part of the service provider, which would make it a \"mutual\" indemnification. Therefore, based on the information provided, the indemnification is not mutual but is instead an obligation solely of the customer towards the service provider."}

'''"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": " Consent Required\n\nTo determine whether the customer's consent is required for the service provider to assign its rights under the MSA to a third party, I have analyzed the provided content of the Master Service Agreement. The relevant section that addresses the issue of assignment is found on page 10, where it states:\n\n\"XII.9. Assignment Customer may not assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of Adverity.\"\n\nThis clause explicitly requires the customer to obtain the prior written consent of Adverity (the service provider) before the customer can assign its rights or obligations under the MSA. Although this clause directly addresses the customer's ability to assign its rights, it does not explicitly mention the service provider's ability to assign its rights.\n\nHowever, the clause continues:\n\n\"Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may assign this MSA and all rights and obligations arising therefrom in its entirety...\"\n\nThis part of the clause suggests that both parties, including the service provider, have the ability to assign the MSA and all rights and obligations arising from it. The use of the term \"either party\" indicates that the provision applies to both the customer and the service provider.\n\nThe key to answering the question lies in understanding whether the phrase \"Notwithstanding the foregoing\" creates an exception to the requirement of the customer's consent for the service provider to assign its rights. This phrase typically indicates that what follows may override or set aside the previous statements. However, the text does not explicitly state that the service provider can assign its rights without the customer's consent, only that either party may assign the MSA in its entirety.\n\nGiven the absence of a clear statement that the service provider can assign its rights without the customer's consent, and considering the general principle of contract interpretation that exceptions to general rules should be explicitly stated, it is reasonable to conclude that the customer's consent would be required for the service provider to assign its rights under the MSA to a third party.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the standard principles of contract interpretation, the answer is that the MSA does require the customer's consent for the service provider to assign its rights under the MSA to a third party."}

Unless otherwise stated in the Commercial Agreement, all Subscriptions automatically renew for additional periods equal to the expiring Subscription Term or one year, whichever is longer, unless either party gives the other notice of non-renewal at least 90 days before the end of the relevant Subscription Term.\n\n3. Termination for Cause: Either party may terminate the MSA for cause at any time, specifically:\n   a. Upon 30 days' written notice to the other party of a material breach if such breach remains uncured at the expiration of such period.\n   b. If the assets of the other party become the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any other similar proceeding.\n\n4. Refund or Payment upon Termination: Upon termination for cause by the Customer, the service provider (Adverity) must refund any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the Term after the Effective Date of termination. Conversely, if Adverity terminates for cause, the Customer must pay any unpaid fees covering the remainder of the term of all Commercial Agreements after the Effective Date of termination. Termination does not relieve the Customer of the obligation to pay any fees payable to Adverity for the period prior to the Effective Date of termination.\n\n5. Return of Customer Data: After termination of the MSA, Customer Data remains stored in the Application Services for a period of 7 days. After this period, Adverity will delete the Customer Data and destroy any corresponding documents, except where legally required to retain such data.\n\n6. Surviving Provisions: Certain sections of the MSA will survive any termination or expiration, including Sections IV (Fees and Payment), V (Proprietary Rights), VI (Confidentiality), VII (Warranties; Disclaimers), VIII (Indemnification), IX (Limitation of Liability), X.4 (Refund or Payment upon Termination), X.5 (Return of Customer Data), X.6 (Surviving Provisions), and XII (Miscellaneous).\n\nThe analysis of the termination terms requires a comprehensive review of the relevant sections of the MSA, particularly those on page 9, which detail the conditions under which the agreement can be terminated, the notice required for non-renewal, the consequences of termination for cause, and the provisions that will survive termination. The terms \"termination\" and \"term\" are used interchangeably in the context of the agreement to refer to the end of the contractual relationship and the conditions under which it can occur."}

The relevant section was found on 'page_number': 9, where it states that automatic renewal will occur unless notice of non-renewal is given. The agreement clearly stipulates that a 90-day notice period is required to prevent automatic renewal. This means that the customer must inform the service provider of their intention not to renew the service at least 90 days before the current Subscription Term ends.\n\nThe core meaning of the question was to determine whether the customer has an obligation to act (provide notice) to prevent the automatic continuation of the service agreement and, if so, the timeframe within which they must do so.

Please provide a yes or no answer if possible.'''"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes\n\nThe Master Service Agreement (MSA) provides the opportunity for the service provider to cure a material breach. This is evidenced by the content on page 4, which states that each party has the right to terminate the agreement upon written notice if the other party materially breaches any of its obligations under the agreement and does not cure such material breach within thirty (30) days from the date of notice.\n\nThe key terms to focus on in the question are \"terminate for a material breach\" and \"opportunity to cure the material breach.\" The MSA explicitly mentions the right to terminate for a material breach and the provision of a 30-day cure period. This indicates that the service provider (PSP) is given a chance to remedy the breach before the customer (Client) can terminate the agreement. The inclusion of a cure period is a common clause in contracts that allows the breaching party to address and resolve the breach within a specified timeframe to avoid termination of the contract.\n\nThe analysis involves understanding the contractual terms related to termination rights and breach remedies. The MSA's language on page 4 provides a clear connection between the right to terminate and the opportunity to cure, which directly answers the question. The agreement does not need to use the exact phrase \"opportunity to cure\" as long as the concept is present and the terms used convey the same meaning. In this case, the MSA's language is sufficient to affirm that the service provider has the opportunity to cure a material breach before the contract can be terminated by the customer for that breach."}

{"role": "user", "content": " Read the question properly and analyze the Master Service Agreement agreement on the basis of this question.\\    \n    Question:'''Does the MSA allow the customer to terminate for a material breach by the service provider?  Please provide a yes or no answer if possible.'''"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes\n\nThe Master Service Agreement (MSA) does allow the customer to terminate for a material breach by the service provider. This is explicitly stated in the content provided on page 9 under the section \"X.3. Termination for Cause.\" The relevant clause states that \"a party may terminate this MSA for cause any time, in particular: a. upon 30 days\u2019 written notice to the other party of a material breach if such breach remains uncured at the expiration of such period.\"\n\nThe term \"material breach\" is a common legal concept that refers to a significant violation of the terms of an agreement, which would justify the non-breaching party in terminating the contract. The clause provides a clear mechanism for termination in the event of such a breach, requiring the non-breaching party to give a 30-day written notice to the breaching party. If the breaching party fails to cure the breach within the 30-day notice period, the non-breaching party has the right to terminate the MSA.\n\nThe question asks whether the MSA allows the customer to terminate for a material breach by the service provider. Based on the clause mentioned above, the answer is affirmative. The customer, as a party to the MSA, has the right to terminate the agreement if the service provider commits a material breach that remains uncured after the notice period.\n\nIt is important to note that the right to terminate for cause is reciprocal, meaning that both the customer and the service provider have the right to terminate the MSA for a material breach by the other party. This is indicated by the use of the term \"a party,\" which is inclusive of both the customer and the service provider.\n\nThe analysis of the termination clause is crucial in understanding the rights and remedies available to the parties in the event of a breach. The provision for termination for cause is a standard clause in MSAs that protects the interests of both parties by allowing them to exit the agreement if the other party fails to uphold their contractual obligations."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " Consent Required\n\nTo determine whether the Master Service Agreement (MSA) requires the customer's consent for the service provider to assign its rights under the MSA to a third party, I have carefully reviewed the provided content of the MSA. The relevant section that addresses this issue is found on page 6, which states:\n\n\"Neither Party shall assign any of its rights or delegate any of its duties under this Agreement without the other Party\u2019s express, prior written consent. Any such assignment or delegation in violation of this Section shall be void.\"\n\nThis clause clearly stipulates that neither party to the agreement (which includes the service provider, referred to as \"PSP\") is permitted to assign their rights or delegate their duties to a third party without obtaining the express, prior written consent of the other party (in this case, the \"Client\"). The use of the term \"express, prior written consent\" indicates that explicit permission must be granted in writing before any such assignment or delegation can take place. Furthermore, the clause declares that any attempt to assign or delegate in violation of this requirement would be considered void, meaning it would have no legal effect.\n\nThe question asks whether the MSA requires the customer's consent for the service provider to assign its rights to a third party. Based on the clause found on page 6, it is evident that the MSA does indeed require such consent. Therefore, the service provider cannot unilaterally assign its rights under the MSA to a third party without first obtaining the customer's consent in writing.\n\nIn conclusion, the MSA mandates that the customer must provide consent before the service provider can assign its rights under the agreement to a third party. This requirement is designed to protect the interests of both parties and ensure that any such assignment is mutually agreed upon."}

If so then What are the intellectual property rights for customer in this agreement?'''"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "\n\nUpon reviewing the provided excerpts from the Master Service Agreement (MSA), there are several clauses that pertain to intellectual property rights, which can be pieced together to understand the rights owned by the customer.\n\nFirstly, section 6.1 titled \"Reservation of Rights\" on page 6 indicates that, subject to the limited rights expressly granted under the agreement, the service provider (SFDC), its affiliates, licensors, and content providers reserve all of their rights, title, and interest in and to the services and content, including all related intellectual property rights. This suggests that the service provider retains ownership of its intellectual property, but it does not explicitly mention the customer's intellectual property rights.\n\nHowever, section 6.3 on the same page provides a clue about the customer's intellectual property rights. It states that the customer grants SFDC a worldwide, limited-term license to host, copy, use, transmit, and display any non-SFDC applications and program code created by or for the customer using a service or for use by the customer with the services, and customer data, as appropriate for SFDC to provide and ensure the proper operation of the services and associated systems in accordance with the agreement. This implies that the customer owns the intellectual property rights to the non-SFDC applications, program code, and customer data they provide or create for use with the services.\n\nAdditionally, section 9.1 on page 7 discusses indemnification by SFDC for claims against the customer alleging that any purchased service infringes or misappropriates a third party's intellectual property rights. This indicates that SFDC is responsible for the intellectual property rights related to the services they provide, but it does not directly address the customer's intellectual property rights.\n\nIn summary, while the MSA does not contain a provision that explicitly states the intellectual property rights owned by the customer, it can be inferred from section 6.3 that the customer retains ownership of any non-SFDC applications, program code, and customer data they provide or create for use with the services.

{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes\n\nThe Master Service Agreement (MSA) does require the customer to pay charges or penalties in the event of late payment. This is evidenced by the content provided on page 3, which states under section IV.4. Overdue Charges: \"If any amounts invoiced are not received by Adverity by the due date, then, without limiting Adverity\u2019s rights or remedies, a. such charges may accrue late interest at the statutory commercial interest rate; b. Adverity shall be entitled to a no-fault and no-damage lump-sum compensation in the amount of 40,00 USD for reimbursement of debts collection costs for each outstanding debt; and c. Adverity may condition future Subscription renewals and Commercial Agreements on payment terms different than those specified in Section IV.3.\"\n\nFrom this section, we can infer that there are specific penalties for late payments, which include the accrual of interest at the statutory commercial interest rate and a lump-sum compensation fee for debt collection costs. Additionally, the MSA mentions the possibility of changing payment terms for future subscriptions or agreements if there is a history of late payments, which can be seen as a form of penalty or consequence for not meeting payment obligations on time.\n\nThe analysis of the MSA required understanding the core meaning of the question, which was to determine if there are financial consequences for the customer in the event of late payment. By reviewing the relevant sections of the MSA, particularly those related to fees and payments, it was possible to identify the clauses that establish the charges and penalties applicable to late payments."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " The intellectual property rights for the customer in this Master Service Agreement (MSA) are limited and primarily pertain to the customer's own data and any suggestions or improvements they may provide to the licensor's products.\n\nFrom the provided content, we can deduce the following regarding intellectual property rights:\n\n1. Ownership of Pre-existing Intellectual Property:\n   - Clause 11.1 on page 10 states that the ownership of any Intellectual Property Rights owned by either party prior to the Commencement Date of the agreement is unaffected. This means that any intellectual property the customer already owned before entering into this agreement remains their property.\n\n2. Ownership of Data:\n   - Clause 10.1 on page 9 indicates that the customer owns all Intellectual Property Rights in \"Your Data.\" This suggests that any data the customer provides or generates while using the services remains their intellectual property.\n\n3. License to Use Customer Data:\n   - Clause 10.2 on the same page grants the licensor and its suppliers a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use the customer's data to provide the services during the term of the agreement. This is a common provision allowing the service provider to handle and process the customer's data as necessary to fulfill the services outlined in the MSA.\n\n4. Assignment of Rights in Suggestions and Improvements:\n   - Clauses 4.7 and 11.6 on pages 26 and 10, respectively, require the customer to assign to the licensor any Intellectual Property Rights they may have in any comments, suggestions, or requests for new features related to the licensor's products (referred to as \"Improvement Suggestions\"). This means that any feedback or ideas the customer provides that could improve the licensor's products automatically become the property of the licensor.\n\n5. Restrictions on Customer's Use of Intellectual Property:\n   - Various clauses (4.2, 4.3, 11.2, and 11.3) across pages 26 and 10 make it clear that the licensor retains ownership of all Intellectual Property Rights in the Licensed Software Development Kits (SDKs), the AHI Platform, and the Documentation. The customer is expressly prohibited from claiming ownership of these items or any modifications thereof.\n   - Clause 4.5 on page 26 further restricts the customer from doing anything that might invalidate or interfere with the licensor's Intellectual Property Rights.\n\n6. Indemnification by Customer:\n   - Clause 10.7 on page 9 requires the customer to indemnify the licensor against any claims that the use of the customer's data infringes on the Intellectual Property Rights of any third party.\n\nIn summary, the customer retains ownership of their pre-existing intellectual property and their data. They grant a license to the licensor to use their data for the purpose of providing the services. However, the customer must assign any intellectual property in suggestions or improvements to the licensor's products to the licensor and is restricted from using the licensor's intellectual property beyond the scope of the agreement. The customer is also responsible for indemnifying the licensor against any infringement claims related to their data."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes\n\nThe Master Service Agreement (MSA) explicitly provides the opportunity for the service provider to cure a material breach.

If the service provider manages to cure the breach within this 30-day notice period, the grounds for termination for cause by the customer would not exist as the breach would no longer be uncured.\n\nThe question asks whether the contract allows for the opportunity to cure a material breach by the service provider, and based on the clause found in the MSA, the answer is affirmative. The agreement contemplates a cure period, which is a common provision in such agreements to allow the party in breach an opportunity to rectify the situation before the agreement can be terminated for cause."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " California\n\nThe question asks for the governing law of the Master Service Agreement (MSA). The term \"governing law\" refers to the legal jurisdiction whose laws will be applied to interpret, enforce, and resolve disputes related to the agreement.\n\nIn the provided content of the MSA, there are multiple references to the State of California. Specifically, on page 16, it states, \"The arbitrator will apply the substantive law of the State of California and of the United States, excluding their conflict or choice of law rules.\" Additionally, on page 10, the content explicitly states, \"The governing law for this contract is US state of California.\"\n\nThese references make it clear that the laws of the State of California are intended to govern the MSA. The mention of the United States law alongside California law suggests that federal law may also be applicable where relevant, but the specific mention of California as the governing law indicates that California state law is the primary legal framework for the MSA.\n\nThe Federal Arbitration Act is also mentioned on page 16, indicating that it governs any arbitration conducted under the agreement. However, this does not change the governing law for the MSA itself, which is specifically identified as California law.\n\nTherefore, based on the content provided and the context of the question, the governing law for the MSA is the law of the State of California."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " 60 days\n\nThe question asks for the amount of notice required by the service provider to provide to the customer in order to increase the price of the service. In the context of the Master Service Agreement (MSA), the term \"service provider\" refers to Adverity Inc., and the \"customer\" refers to the entity receiving the services under the MSA.\n\nUpon reviewing the provided content of the MSA, the relevant information is found on page 9, where it states: \"At any time, during the Term, maximum once per calendar year, the Fees shall automatically increase by either 7% or the official inflation rate (based on the Consumer Price Index published in the United States by U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in the month preceding Adverity\u2019s notice of increase), whichever is higher, to support Adverity's continual efforts to expand and enhance its Application Services. Adverity will notify the Customer about an increase of the Fees 60 days in advance.\"\n\nThis excerpt clearly specifies that Adverity, the service provider, is obligated to notify the customer of an increase in fees 60 days in advance. This provision is specific to the scenario where Adverity intends to increase the price of the service, and it establishes the notice period required for such an increase.\n\nThe process of determining the answer involved identifying the relevant section of the MSA that discusses price increases and the notice period associated with such increases. By analyzing the content of page 9, it was possible to locate the specific provision that directly answers the question. The key terms \"increase of the Fees\" and \"notify the Customer\" were crucial in understanding the context and finding the exact number of days required for notice, which is 60 days."}

Please provide a yes or no answer if possible.'''"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes\n\nThe question asks whether the service provider is required to indemnify the customer for attorney's fees under the Master Service Agreement (MSA). To answer this question, we need to look at the provisions of the MSA that discuss indemnification and the awarding of attorney's fees.\n\nFrom the provided content of the MSA, we can see that Section 11 deals with indemnity. Specifically, Section 11.1 (page 13) states that \"Stripe will defend you against any IP Claim and indemnify you against all IP Claim Losses.\" While this section does not explicitly mention attorney's fees, it does refer to indemnifying against all losses, which could be interpreted to include legal costs such as attorney's fees.\n\nFurther analysis of the content on page 17 reveals that \"the arbitrator will award to the prevailing party, if any, the costs and attorneys\u2019 fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with those aspects of its claims or defenses on which it prevails.\" This indicates that in the context of arbitration arising out of the agreement, the prevailing party is entitled to recover attorney's fees.\n\nAdditionally, Section 11.2 (page 15) states, \"You will indemnify the Stripe Parties against all Stripe Losses arising out of or relating to Claims described in this Section 11.2.\" Again, while not explicitly mentioning attorney's fees, the term \"all Stripe Losses\" could be interpreted to include such fees.\n\nBased on the language in these sections, it can be inferred that the service provider (in this case, Stripe) is required to indemnify the customer for attorney's fees if they are the prevailing party in an arbitration proceeding or if the indemnification is for \"all losses\" or \"all Stripe Losses,\" which can reasonably be interpreted to include attorney's fees.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is \"Yes,\" the service provider is required to indemnify the customer for attorney's fees, as indicated by the language in the MSA that allows for the recovery of such fees by the prevailing party in arbitration and the broad language used in the indemnification clauses."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes\n\nThe Master Service Agreement (MSA) does allow the customer to terminate the MSA for causes other than a material breach. This can be inferred from the content provided on page 9 under the section \"X.3. Termination for Cause.\" The agreement states that a party may terminate the MSA for cause at any time, and it provides two specific instances that qualify as \"for cause\" termination:\n\na. Upon 30 days\u2019 written notice to the other party of a material breach if such breach remains uncured at the expiration of such period;\nb. If the assets of the other party become the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or in any other similar proceeding.\n\nWhile the first instance (a) clearly refers to a material breach, the second instance (b) provides an additional cause for termination that is not related to a breach of the agreement but rather to the financial insolvency of the other party. This indicates that the agreement contemplates termination for causes other than a material breach.\n\nFurthermore, the agreement does not explicitly state that these are the only reasons for which the MSA can be terminated for cause. The use of the phrase \"in particular\" suggests that the listed reasons are examples and not an exhaustive list. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the MSA allows for termination for cause in circumstances other than a material breach, provided that such circumstances meet the definition of \"for cause\" as understood in the context of the agreement and applicable law.\n\nThe thought process here involves understanding the language used in the termination clause and recognizing that the examples given are not exclusive, allowing for the possibility of other \"for cause\" scenarios that could lead to termination of the MSA by the customer."}

If Stripe revises the Fees for a Service that you are currently using, Stripe will notify you at least 30 days before the revised Fees apply to you.\"\n\nThis clause clearly indicates that Stripe reserves the right to revise the fees associated with the services provided under the agreement. The provision also outlines the process for such a revision, which includes giving the client a 30-day notice before the new fees take effect. This allows for an increase in the fees or payment that the client is obligated to pay under the terms of the MSA.\n\nThe question asked whether the contract has a provision for increasing fees, payments, or prices.

Please provide a yes or no answer if possible.'''"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes\n\nThe Master Service Agreement (MSA) does allow the customer to terminate for a material breach by the service provider. This is evidenced by the content provided on page 4, which states, \"Each Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other Party if the other Party materially breaches any of its obligations under this Agreement and does not cure such material breach within thirty (30) days from the date of notice.\" This clause clearly establishes the right of the customer (referred to as \"Client\" in the MSA) to terminate the agreement if the service provider (referred to as \"PSP\" in the MSA) commits a material breach of its obligations and fails to remedy that breach within the specified cure period of thirty days.\n\nThe process of analyzing this question involved identifying the key terms related to termination rights in the context of a material breach. The term \"material breach\" is a common legal concept that refers to a significant violation of the terms of an agreement, which would justify termination. The MSA specifies that both parties have the right to terminate the agreement upon a material breach by the other party, provided that the breaching party is given notice and a chance to cure the breach within the allotted time frame. If the breach is not cured within that time, the non-breaching party has the right to terminate the agreement.\n\nThe MSA also includes provisions that survive termination (as seen on pages 4 and 6), which indicates that certain obligations and rights continue even after the agreement is terminated. This is a standard clause in MSAs to ensure that both parties maintain their responsibilities with respect to confidentiality, indemnification, and other important matters post-termination.\n\nIn conclusion, the MSA provides a clear mechanism for the customer to terminate the agreement in the event of a material breach by the service provider, subject to the service provider's right to cure the breach within a specified period."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes\n\nThe Master Service Agreement (MSA) explicitly states that the service provider (PSP) is required to indemnify the customer (Client) for attorney's fees. This is evident from the content provided on page 6, which includes the clause: \"PSP shall indemnify, defend, and hold Client harmless from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, costs (including reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys\u2019 fees) (collectively, \u201cLosses\u201d) incurred by any of such parties resulting from any third-party claim, suit, action, or proceeding (each, a \u201cClaim\u201d)\". \n\nThis clause clearly outlines the PSP's obligation to cover not only losses, damages, and liabilities but also the costs associated with these, which explicitly includes reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys' fees. The use of the term \"including\" before specifying \"reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys\u2019 fees\" indicates that such fees are a component of the indemnification coverage.\n\nFurthermore, the agreement reinforces this obligation in the same section on page 6, where it states: \"The prevailing Party shall be awarded its reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in any such action.\" This suggests that in the event of a dispute that goes to court, the winning party will be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, which is consistent with the indemnification clause that requires the PSP to cover such fees if they are the party indemnifying the Client.\n\nThe analysis of the MSA requires understanding the indemnification clause and its implications. The clause's language is clear in stating that indemnification by the PSP includes covering attorney's fees, which is a common provision in such agreements to ensure that the indemnified party is not out-of-pocket for legal costs incurred due to claims covered by the indemnification."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes, the MSA does require the service provider to notify the customer in the event of a data breach. The deadline by which the MSA requires the service provider to give the customer notice of the data breach is within forty-eight hours.\n\nTo arrive at this conclusion, I analyzed the content of the provided Master Service Agreement (MSA) excerpts, focusing on the terms related to data breaches and notification requirements. The relevant section of the MSA is found on page 9, under the heading \"6. Personal Data Breach.\" It states that the service provider (referred to as PSP in the agreement) will notify the client \"promptly, and in any event within forty-eight hours, of any Personal Data Breach.\"\n\nThis clause clearly sets forth the obligation of the service provider to inform the customer of a data breach and establishes a specific timeframe for doing so, which is forty-eight hours from the time the service provider becomes aware of the breach. The use of the term \"in any event\" emphasizes the mandatory nature of this deadline, indicating that the notification must occur within this period without exception.\n\nThe MSA uses the term \"PSP\" to refer to the service provider and \"Client\" to refer to the customer. The question uses the term \"service provider\" and \"customer,\" which correspond to \"PSP\" and \"Client\" in the MSA, respectively. The term \"data breach\" in the question is equivalent to \"Personal Data Breach\" as used in the MSA.\n\nThe requirement for prompt notification is a common provision in data protection clauses within MSAs, as it is crucial for the customer to be aware of any potential data breaches in order to take timely action to mitigate the effects of such breaches and comply with applicable data protection laws.\n\nTherefore, based on the content of the MSA provided, the service provider is contractually obligated to notify the customer within forty-eight hours in the event of a data breach."}

Please provide answer in number of months or years'''"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": " The time period between each automatic renewal of the services under the Master Service Agreement (MSA) is one year.\n\nTo arrive at this conclusion, I analyzed the content provided from the MSA, particularly focusing on the terms related to the renewal of subscriptions. The key information is found in the content from 'page_number': 9, which states, \"Except as otherwise specified in the applicable Commercial Agreement, all Subscriptions shall automatically renew for additional periods equal to the expiring Subscription Term or one year (whichever is higher), unless either party gives the other notice of non-renewal at least 90 days before the end of the relevant Subscription Term.\"\n\nThis clause indicates that the automatic renewal period will be the same as the expiring Subscription Term unless it is less than one year, in which case the renewal period will be one year. Since the MSA does not provide the specific length of the original Subscription Term, we default to the one-year period mentioned as the minimum renewal term. It is important to note that this is subject to any different terms that might be specified in the applicable Commercial Agreement, which is not provided here. However, based on the information available in the MSA, the renewal period is one year.\n\nThe thought process involved understanding the language used in the agreement that pertains to the renewal of services. The phrase \"additional periods equal to the expiring Subscription Term or one year (whichever is higher)\" was the focal point, as it sets the baseline for the renewal period. The absence of a specified Subscription Term in the provided excerpts leads to the conclusion that the default renewal period is one year, as it is the only time frame mentioned in the context of renewal."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes\n\nThe Master Service Agreement (MSA) explicitly provides for termination for cause. This is evident from the content provided on page 9, which states:\n\n\"X.3. Termination for Cause\nA party may terminate this MSA for cause any time, in particular:\na. upon 30 days\u2019 written notice to the other party of a material breach if such breach remains uncured at the expiration of such period; or\nb. if the assets of the other party become the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or in any other similar proceeding.\"\n\nThe clause outlines two specific scenarios where either party may terminate the agreement for cause: (a) a material breach that remains uncured after a 30-day notice period, and (b) if the other party's assets become subject to bankruptcy or similar proceedings. This provision allows for the protection of the parties' interests in the event of significant issues that may impact the performance of the agreement.\n\nThe term \"for cause\" is a legal term that typically refers to a justified or legally sufficient reason for taking a particular action, such as terminating an agreement. In this context, the MSA defines what constitutes \"cause\" for termination, providing clear grounds upon which the parties can act if the agreement is not being adhered to as intended.\n\nThe inclusion of a termination for cause clause is a common feature in contracts to ensure that parties have a formal and enforceable method of exiting the agreement under serious circumstances that affect the integrity or viability of the contractual relationship."}

This indicates that the agreement goes into effect on February 4, 2023.\n\nThe term \"Effective Date\" is a standard term used in contracts to specify the date when the agreement's terms and conditions begin to apply. It is common for agreements to explicitly state this date near the beginning of the document, as it is a critical piece of information for both parties involved.\n\nIn this case, the date is provided in the format of \"04 February, 2023,\" which corresponds to the mm/dd/yy format as 02/04/23. It is important to note that the format requested in the question is the American standard where the month precedes the day. Therefore, the answer to the question is the date in the requested format, which is 02/04/23."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes, the MSA does include a limitation of liability clause. The relevant sections detailing the limitation of liability are found on page 8 of the MSA.\n\nThe limitation of liability clause is outlined in Section IX, specifically in subsections IX.1 and IX.2. Section IX.1, titled \"General Limitation of Liability,\" states that in the case of material or pecuniary damages caused by not more than ordinary negligence, Adverity and its assistants shall only be liable for breaches of essential contractual obligations. However, this liability is limited to an amount of damages which could have been anticipated upon signing and which are typical for the contract. It also specifies that nothing in the MSA shall limit or exclude either party's liability for death or personal injury caused by its negligence, for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, or any other liability that may not be excluded or limited by law.\n\nSection IX.2, titled \"Limitation of Amount of Liability,\" further clarifies the financial limitation by stating that Adverity\u2019s total liability for Customer\u2019s claims arising in any contract year under or in connection with the MSA shall be limited to the greater of: a) the total of all fees paid by Customer to Adverity in a 12-month period preceding the damaging event; or b) 50,000 USD.\n\nTherefore, the amount to which liability is limited under this MSA is the greater of the total fees paid by the Customer in the preceding 12 months or 50,000 USD. This limitation applies irrespective of the legal theory on which the damage claims are based, including tort claims, with the exception of the exclusions mentioned in IX.1 (such as liability for death or personal injury due to negligence, fraud, or other liabilities that cannot be excluded by law).\n\nThe thought process involved in answering this question required a careful reading of the provided MSA content, particularly focusing on the sections that discuss liability. By piecing together the relevant excerpts from Section IX on page 8, it was possible to determine the presence of a limitation of liability clause and the specific financial cap on liability as outlined in the agreement."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " The name of the service provider in the Master Service Agreement is \"Expel, Inc.\"\n\nTo determine the name of the service provider, I analyzed the provided JSON-formatted Master Service Agreement agreement.

In the context of a Master Service Agreement, this would be the party that is responsible for delivering the services outlined in the agreement to the customer.\n\nUpon reviewing the content of the agreement, I found that the term \"Expel\" is repeatedly mentioned in conjunction with the provision of services. Specifically, the content on 'page_number': 1 states, \"THIS USER AGREEMENT, together with the Data Processing Addendum, is made on the Effective Date BETWEEN 21 March 2022 to 21 September 2022 (1) Expel, Inc., a company incorporated in Delaware, United States of America whose registered office is at 12950 Worldgate Drive #200, Herndon, VA 20170 U.S.A.

{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes, the MSA does require the service provider to notify the customer in the event of a data breach. The deadline by which the MSA requires the service provider to give the customer notice of the data breach is within 1 hour.\n\nTo arrive at this conclusion, I analyzed the content of the provided Master Service Agreement agreement, specifically looking for clauses related to data security and breach notification requirements. The relevant section found in the content from 'page_number': 12, 'content': explicitly states, \"9.4 Data Breach. You must notify Stripe within 1 hour if you become aware of an unauthorized acquisition, modification, disclosure, access to, or loss of Personal Data on your systems.\"\n\nThis clause clearly mandates that the service provider (in this case, the party obligated to notify Stripe) must inform the customer (Stripe) of any data breach involving unauthorized access or loss of Personal Data within a very specific timeframe of 1 hour after becoming aware of such an event. The use of the term \"must\" indicates an obligation, and the specification of \"within 1 hour\" provides a clear and unambiguous deadline for this notification to occur.\n\nThe question's core meaning was to determine whether there is an obligation for the service provider to notify the customer in the event of a data breach and, if so, the timeframe within which this notification must be made. By focusing on the terms related to data breach and notification within the agreement, I was able to identify the relevant clause that directly answers the question. The answer is provided in terms of hours, as requested."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes, the MSA does include provisions regarding the intellectual property rights owned by the service provider. The relevant sections of the Master Service Agreement (MSA) that address the intellectual property rights of the Platform Service Provider (PSP) are found primarily on page 5 of the agreement.\n\nThe MSA specifies that the PSP retains all rights and licenses and owns all right, title, and interest in and to the Platform, PSP Data, and derivatives thereof. It is explicitly stated that, other than as expressly set forth in the agreement, no license or other rights in or to the PSP Data or intellectual property are granted to the Client, and all such licenses and rights are hereby expressly reserved by the PSP.\n\nThis means that the PSP maintains ownership and control over its intellectual property, and the Client is not entitled to any rights in the PSP's intellectual property beyond what is explicitly granted within the agreement. The rights granted to the Client are likely to be limited to accessing and using the PSP Data and Platform as per the terms of the MSA and any Order Forms that are part of the agreement.\n\nFurthermore, the MSA includes indemnification provisions on page 6 that protect the PSP from claims related to the Client's unauthorized use of the PSP Data or Platform, which further underscores the importance of the intellectual property rights held by the PSP.\n\nIn summary, the intellectual property rights for the service provider in this agreement are comprehensive, with the PSP retaining all rights and ownership over its Platform, PSP Data, and any derivatives. The Client's rights are limited to what is expressly granted in the MSA, and the PSP is protected from infringement or misuse of its intellectual property by the Client through indemnification clauses."}

The clause specifies \"attorneys\u2019 fees\" as one of the costs for which the customer must indemnify the service provider, which directly answers the question.\n\nThe indemnification obligation is contingent upon Adverity providing prompt written notice of the claim to the customer, which is a standard condition in indemnification clauses to allow the indemnifying party to defend the claim or be involved in the settlement process.\n\nTherefore, based on the indemnification clause provided in the MSA, the customer is indeed required to indemnify the service provider for attorney's fees in the event of a third-party claim as described."}

The key information relevant to the question is found in the first object, which defines the \"Subscription Start Date\" and \"Subscription End Date\" as per the Commercial Agreement. Specifically, the \"Subscription End Date\" is mentioned as \"28 November 2023.\"\n\nThe term \"Subscription End Date\" is indicative of the date on which the services provided under the agreement will be withdrawn from the customer, which can be interpreted as the termination date of the agreement's term, assuming there are no extensions or renewals beyond this date.\n\nFurther analysis of the content, particularly on page 9, reveals that subscriptions will automatically renew for additional periods equal to the expiring Subscription Term or one year, whichever is higher, unless either party gives notice of non-renewal at least 90 days before the end of the relevant Subscription Term. However, there is no direct indication in the provided content that such a notice has been given or that an automatic renewal has been agreed upon.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and without any evidence to suggest an automatic renewal or extension of the term, the termination date of the agreement's term is the \"Subscription End Date\" as specified in the Commercial Agreement, which is 28 November 2023. When converted into the requested format, the date is 11/28/23."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes\n\nThe Master Service Agreement (MSA) explicitly states that the customer (Client) is required to indemnify the service provider (PSP) for attorney's fees. This is evident from the content provided on page 6, which includes a clause stating that the Client shall indemnify, defend, and hold PSP harmless from and against any losses, damages, liabilities, costs (including reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys\u2019 fees), collectively referred to as \u201cLosses,\u201d incurred by PSP resulting from any third-party claim, suit, action, or proceeding.\n\nThe question asks whether the customer is required to indemnify the service provider for attorney's fees. The term \"indemnify\" generally means to compensate for harm or loss, and in the context of legal agreements, it often includes covering legal costs such as attorney's fees. The MSA specifically includes \"reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys\u2019 fees\" as part of the costs for which the Client is responsible in the event of a third-party claim against PSP that falls within the scope of the indemnification clause.\n\nFurthermore, the agreement on page 6 also states that \"The prevailing Party shall be awarded its reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in any such action.\" This reinforces the requirement that the indemnifying party (in this case, the Client) would be responsible for the attorney's fees incurred by the indemnified party (PSP) if PSP is the prevailing party in a legal action.\n\nTherefore, based on the indemnification clause and the provision regarding the award of attorneys' fees to the prevailing party, it is clear that the customer is indeed required to indemnify the service provider for attorney's fees as part of the indemnification obligations set forth in the MSA."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes, the customer does have to send a notice to stop the auto-renewal of the contract. The notice period required to stop automatic renewal is 7 days in advance.\n\nThe relevant section of the Master Service Agreement (MSA) that addresses termination by the customer is found on page 8, under the heading \"(a) Your Termination.\" The content of this section states: \"You may terminate this Agreement by writing a notice of 7 days in advance and by closing your Stripe Account.\"\n\nTo arrive at this answer, I analyzed the provided content of the MSA for any clauses that pertain to the termination of the agreement by the customer, specifically looking for any mention of a notice period required to terminate the agreement and prevent automatic renewal. The term \"auto-renewal\" is not explicitly used in the provided excerpts of the MSA, but the process described under \"(a) Your Termination\" effectively serves the same purpose as stopping an auto-renewal by allowing the customer to terminate the agreement.\n\nThe MSA does not explicitly state that the agreement will automatically renew, but the standard practice in service agreements is that unless a party provides notice of termination, the agreement may continue under the same terms or renew. Therefore, the instruction for the customer to provide a notice of 7 days in advance to terminate the agreement is understood to be the action required to prevent any form of automatic continuation or renewal of the contract.\n\nIt is important to note that the specific term \"auto-renewal\" may not be used in the MSA, but the concept of terminating the agreement to prevent continuation is what is relevant to the question. The provided content does not mention any other conditions or requirements for the notice other than the 7-day advance notice period. Therefore, based on the information available, a customer must provide a notice of termination 7 days in advance to stop the automatic renewal or continuation of the contract."}

The key provisions related to termination are as follows:\n\n1. Initial Term: As per the content on page 1, the initial term of the agreement begins on the Effective Date and continues for a period of 4 months.\n\n2. Termination Rights: On page 4, it is stated that both PSP (Platform Service Provider) and Client have the right to terminate the agreement upon written notice of 30 days. Additionally, either party can terminate the agreement if the other party materially breaches any of its obligations under the agreement and does not cure such breach within thirty (30) days from the date of notice.\n\n3.

{"role": "assistant", "content": " The Master Service Agreement (MSA) requires the customer to provide 30 days' written notice before terminating the contract without cause.\n\nTo arrive at this conclusion, I analyzed the provided content of the MSA, particularly looking for sections that discuss termination rights and procedures. The relevant information is found in the content associated with 'page_number': 9, which states under section X.2. \"Term of Subscriptions\" that Subscriptions to the Application Services commence on the subscription start date and continue for the subscription term specified in the Commercial Agreement. However, it does not mention the notice period for termination without cause.\n\nThe key to answering the question lies in the content associated with 'page_number': 8, which under section X.3. \"Termination for Cause\" provides for a 30 days' written notice in the event of a material breach that remains uncured. While this section deals with termination for cause, it is common in MSAs to have a similar or identical notice period for termination without cause unless otherwise specified.\n\nSince the provided excerpts of the MSA do not contain a specific section detailing the notice period for termination without cause, we must infer from the context and standard practice in such agreements. Given that the MSA specifies a 30 days' notice period for termination for cause, it is reasonable to infer that the same or a similar notice period would apply for termination without cause, unless the MSA explicitly states otherwise, which it does not in the provided content.\n\nTherefore, based on the information available and standard contract interpretation principles, the answer is that the MSA likely requires a 30 days' written notice for termination without cause, as this is the notice period specified for termination for cause and no other specific provision for termination without cause is provided in the excerpts of the MSA."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " $40,000\n\nTo determine the total amount to be paid by the customer to the service provider for the services according to the Master Service Agreement (MSA), I have analyzed the provided JSON-formatted agreement content. The key information relevant to the question is found on page 1, where it states \"2. Fees and Payment Schedule [$40,000/-]. All fees shall be due thirty (30) days from the invoice date.\"\n\nThis clause directly provides the total fees that the client agrees to pay for the services under the MSA. It is important to note that the agreement specifies that all fees are due within thirty days of the invoice date, which is a standard payment term in such agreements. Additionally, the agreement mentions that the term of the agreement is for an initial period of 4 months, but this does not affect the total fee amount, as the fee is stated as a lump sum and not as a recurring or installment-based payment.\n\nThe agreement also includes provisions for late payment penalties on page 6, indicating that if any portion of the fees is received by the Platform Service Provider (PSP) after the payment due date, a late penalty fee of 1.5% of the payment amount then due will be assessed. However, this does not change the total amount agreed upon for the services, which is $40,000, unless the client fails to make timely payments and incurs late fees.\n\nFurthermore, the agreement on page 6 under section 9.2 states that fees do not include any taxes, and the client is responsible for paying all taxes associated with its purchases, except for taxes based on PSP's net income. This indicates that the $40,000 fee is exclusive of any applicable taxes, and the client would be responsible for any additional tax amounts.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided in the MSA, the total amount to be paid by the customer to the service provider for the services is $40,000, excluding any applicable taxes and potential late payment penalties."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " The initial term period for this agreement is 6 months.\n\nTo determine the initial term period of the Master Service Agreement (MSA), I analyzed the provided JSON content for references to the term, commencement, and duration of the agreement. The key pieces of information are found on page 1 and page 9 of the agreement.\n\nOn page 1, the agreement defines \"Subscription Start Date\" and \"Subscription End Date\" with specific dates provided: the Subscription Start Date is 28 May 2023, and the Subscription End Date is 28 November 2023. The \"Subscription Term\" is mentioned as the period set forth in an applicable Commercial Agreement, which implies that the Subscription Term is the duration between the Start Date and the End Date.\n\nOn page 9, the content specifies that the term of the MSA is governed by the Subscription granted by the Commercial Agreement and that the Subscriptions commence on the Subscription Start Date and continue for the Subscription Term specified therein.\n\nBy calculating the time between the Subscription Start Date and the Subscription End Date, we can determine the initial term period. From 28 May 2023 to 28 November 2023 is a period of 6 months. Therefore, the initial term period of this MSA, as inferred from the provided dates, is 6 months.\n\nThis analysis is based on the assumption that the \"Subscription Term\" mentioned in the agreement refers to the initial term period of the MSA, as no other specific term period is provided in the excerpts of the agreement. The term \"initial term period\" is not used verbatim in the agreement, but the context suggests that the Subscription Term is the relevant period for determining the initial duration of the agreement."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes\n\nThe Master Service Agreement (MSA) does include an indemnification clause under which the service provider indemnifies the customer. This can be inferred from the content provided on page 8, which states, \"Adverity shall have no obligation to indemnify Customer to the extent any Claim Against Customer arises from Customer\u2019s breach of the terms of this MSA.\" This sentence implies that there are circumstances under which Adverity, the service provider, would have an obligation to indemnify the customer, except when the claim against the customer arises from the customer's own breach of the MSA terms.\n\nFurthermore, the MSA explicitly mentions an \"Indemnification\" section in the list of surviving provisions on page 9, which indicates that there is a detailed indemnification clause present in the agreement. The specific section is \"Section VIII (Indemnification),\" which suggests that both parties have some indemnification obligations, although the exact details of the service provider's indemnification towards the customer are not provided in the excerpts.\n\nThe presence of an indemnification clause is a common feature in MSAs as it outlines the responsibilities of each party in the event of legal claims or damages arising from the performance of the services. The clause typically specifies the extent to which one party agrees to compensate the other for any losses, damages, or legal liabilities incurred due to the actions or omissions of the indemnifying party.\n\nIn summary, based on the information provided, the MSA does contain an indemnification clause where the service provider has certain indemnification responsibilities towards the customer, except in cases where the claim arises from the customer's breach of the MSA."}

If so then What are the intellectual property rights for customer in this agreement?'''"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes, the MSA does include provisions regarding the intellectual property rights owned by the customer. The relevant sections of the Master Service Agreement (MSA) that address the intellectual property rights of the customer are found primarily on page 5 of the agreement.\n\nThe MSA specifies in Section 7.2 that the client retains all rights and licenses, and owns all right, title, and interest in all Client Data the Client provides to PSP. This provision clearly establishes that the intellectual property rights of the customer, in this case referred to as \"Client Data,\" remain with the customer. The agreement does not grant any license or other rights in or to the PSP Data or intellectual property to the Client, except as expressly set forth in the agreement, and all such licenses and rights are expressly reserved (as mentioned in the continuation of the content from page 5).\n\nThe thought process behind this analysis involves identifying the sections of the MSA that pertain to intellectual property rights. The term \"Client Data\" is used within the agreement to refer to the intellectual property of the customer. By examining the content of the agreement, particularly the sections that discuss intellectual property, it becomes clear that the customer retains ownership and control over their intellectual property, which is defined as \"Client Data\" within the context of this MSA.\n\nFurthermore, the agreement includes representations and warranties by the client that it has and will maintain all necessary rights and permissions to provide any Client Data to PSP without violating the rights of any third party (as stated in Section 8.3 on page 5). This reinforces the notion that the client owns the intellectual property rights to the data they provide to PSP and has taken responsibility for ensuring that their provision of data does not infringe on third-party rights.\n\nIn summary, the MSA does contain provisions regarding the intellectual property rights owned by the customer, specifically stating that the customer retains all rights to the Client Data they provide to PSP. The customer's intellectual property rights in this agreement are therefore protected and reserved to the customer, with no additional licenses or rights granted to PSP except as explicitly stated in the agreement."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " The name of the service provider is \"Platform Service Provider\" or \"PSP.\"\n\nTo determine the name of the service provider, I analyzed the provided Master Service Agreement (MSA) agreement text. The term \"service provider\" is commonly used to refer to the entity that provides services under the agreement. In the context of this MSA, the term \"PSP\" is used multiple times, which stands for \"Platform Service Provider.\" This is evident from the first page of the agreement, where it states, \"Platform Service Provider, (\u201cPSP\u201d) Alpha Beta Company, a Alcime company with its principal offices located at New Jersey (\u201cClient\u201d).\"\n\nThe term \"Alpha Beta Company\" appears to be associated with the PSP, indicating that it is the name of the entity providing the services. However, the term \"a Alcime company\" following \"Alpha Beta Company\" suggests that \"Alpha Beta Company\" is a subsidiary or a part of a larger entity known as \"Alcime.\" Therefore, the full name of the service provider is not just \"Alpha Beta Company\" but rather \"Alpha Beta Company, a Alcime company.\"\n\nThe term \"Client\" is used to refer to the other party in the agreement, which is distinct from the service provider. The agreement does not provide a more specific name for the PSP other than \"Platform Service Provider\" and the abbreviation \"PSP.\" The placeholders for signatures at the end of the agreement also refer to the service provider as \"PLATFORM SERVICE PROVIDER (\u201cPSP\u201d)\" without providing a specific legal name.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided in the MSA and the common understanding of the term \"service provider\" within the context of such agreements, the service provider is referred to as \"Platform Service Provider\" or \"PSP,\" and it is associated with \"Alpha Beta Company, a Alcime company.\" The exact legal name of the service provider is not explicitly stated beyond these references."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes\n\nThe Master Service Agreement (MSA) does permit the service provider to use the name or logo of the customer. This is explicitly mentioned in the content provided from page 5 of the MSA, which states that \"either Party may include the name and logo of the other Party in lists (including on its website) of customers or vendors in accordance with the other Party\u2019s standard logo and/or trademark usage guidelines.\" This clause indicates that both parties have the right to use each other's name and logo for the purposes of including them in lists that may be made public, such as on a website, provided that they follow the respective party's guidelines for logo and trademark usage.\n\nThe question asks whether the service provider is permitted to use the customer's name or logo, and based on the clause found on page 5, the answer is affirmative, subject to adherence to the customer's usage guidelines. This is a common provision in MSAs as it allows both parties to publicly acknowledge their business relationship, which can be beneficial for marketing and establishing credibility with other potential clients or vendors. However, it is important to note that any such use must be in compliance with the guidelines set forth by the party owning the logo or trademark, which is typically meant to ensure that the brand is represented consistently and appropriately.\n\nThe analysis required understanding the context of the question, which was about the permission granted within the MSA for the use of names and logos. By identifying the relevant clause on page 5, we can infer that such permission is indeed granted, with the caveat that it must be done in accordance with the other party's guidelines. This is a standard practice in such agreements to protect the integrity of the brands involved."}

If so then What are the intellectual property rights for customer in this agreement?'''"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": " The Master Service Agreement (MSA) does include provisions regarding intellectual property rights (IP Rights) owned by the customer. The relevant sections of the MSA that address IP Rights are found on pages 10, 13, 14, and 26.\n\nFrom the content provided, the following points are pertinent to the customer's IP Rights:\n\n1. Page 10 states, \"Nothing in this Agreement assigns or transfers ownership of any IP Rights to the other party. All rights (including IP Rights) not expressly granted in this Agreement are reserved.\" This indicates that the MSA does not transfer the ownership of any IP Rights from the customer to the service provider, and any rights not explicitly granted remain with the original owner.\n\n2. Page 13 includes a representation by the customer that they have \"obtained, as applicable, all necessary rights and permissions to enable your use of Content in connection with the Services.\" This implies that the customer retains their IP Rights in the content they use in connection with the services provided under the MSA.\n\n3. Page 14 mentions that the customer will indemnify the Stripe Parties against any claim that \"any of the Marks you license to Stripe, or your Content, infringes on or misappropriates the rights, including IP Rights, of the third party making the Claim.\" This suggests that the customer has IP Rights in the marks they license to Stripe and the content they provide.\n\n4. Page 26 defines \"IP Rights\" as \"all copyrights, patents, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, moral rights, and other intellectual property rights.\" This comprehensive definition encompasses the full spectrum of IP Rights that could be owned by the customer.\n\nIn summary, the MSA acknowledges the customer's ownership of their IP Rights and does not transfer those rights to the service provider. The customer is responsible for ensuring they have the necessary rights and permissions for the content they use in connection with the services, and they must indemnify the service provider against claims of infringement. The MSA also reserves all rights not expressly granted, which further protects the customer's IP Rights. The specific rights of the customer would be those that they own or have licensed, which could include copyrights, patents, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, moral rights, and other intellectual property rights as defined in the agreement."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes\n\nThe Master Service Agreement (MSA) explicitly requires the customer to pay charges or penalties in the event of late payment. This is evidenced by the content provided on page number 6, which states: \"Client shall make payment under all invoices within thirty (30) days of receipt of invoice, unless specified differently in the applicable Order Form. If any portion of the fees are received by PSP after the payment due date as set forth herein, then a late penalty fee shall be assessed, equal to 1.5% of the payment amount then due by Client.\"\n\nIn analyzing this provision, it is clear that the MSA sets forth a payment term of 30 days from the receipt of the invoice, after which, if the payment is not made, a late penalty fee of 1.5% of the due amount is imposed on the client. This clause establishes the obligation for the client to incur additional charges if they fail to make timely payments as per the agreed terms in the MSA.\n\nThe question asks whether the MSA requires the customer to pay charges or penalties in the event of late payment. The term \"customer\" in the context of the MSA is synonymous with \"Client,\" and the term \"charges or penalties\" refers to financial consequences for late payment, which in this case is the late penalty fee of 1.5%. Therefore, based on the information provided in the MSA, the answer to the question is affirmative."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes\n\nThe Master Service Agreement (MSA) does require the service provider to delete customer data upon termination of the MSA. This is inferred from the content provided on page 10, which states, \"Stripe is not obligated to retain Protected Data after the Term, except as (w) required by Law; (x) required for Stripe to perform any post-termination obligations; (y) this Agreement otherwise states; or (z) the parties otherwise agree in writing.\"\n\nThe key phrase here is \"Stripe is not obligated to retain Protected Data after the Term,\" which implies that upon the termination of the MSA, Stripe is not required to keep the customer's protected data unless one of the exceptions (w) through (z) applies. Since none of the exceptions explicitly state that Stripe must retain the data at the customer's request, it can be inferred that the default position is for Stripe to delete the data unless required by law or other specific post-termination obligations.\n\nHowever, the MSA does not explicitly mention the deletion of customer data upon request by the customer during the term of the agreement. The provided excerpts do not contain any direct reference to a requirement for Stripe to delete customer data upon the customer's request before the termination of the MSA. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can only confirm the deletion of data upon termination of the MSA, not upon request by the customer during the term of the MSA.\n\nIt is important to note that the MSA may contain other sections or clauses not included in the provided excerpts that could further clarify the obligations regarding the deletion of customer data upon request. In the absence of such information, the answer is based on the available content."}

{"role": "user", "content": " Read the question properly and analyze the Master Service Agreement agreement on the basis of this question.\\    \n    Question:'''According to the MSA, what are the charges or penalties to the customer for late payments?'''"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": " The charges or penalties to the customer for late payments, as per the Master Service Agreement (MSA), are assessed as a late penalty fee equal to 1.5% of the payment amount then due by the Client. This information is found on page 6 of the MSA, where it states, \"If any portion of the fees are received by PSP after the payment due date as set forth herein, then a late penalty fee shall be assessed, equal to 1.5% of the payment amount then due by Client.\"\n\nTo arrive at this answer, I analyzed the content of the MSA provided, specifically looking for terms related to payments, fees, penalties, and charges. The question asks for the charges or penalties for late payments, which implies a financial consequence imposed on the customer (referred to as \"Client\" in the MSA) for not meeting the payment deadlines stipulated in the agreement.\n\nThe term \"late penalty fee\" is directly related to the question, as it represents the financial repercussion for late payments. The MSA specifies the exact percentage of the late fee, which is 1.5% of the due payment amount. This percentage is a common way to structure late payment penalties in commercial agreements, providing a clear and calculable consequence for late payments, incentivizing timely payment, and compensating the service provider (referred to as \"PSP\" in the MSA) for the delay.\n\nIt is important to note that the MSA does not specify a cap on the late penalty fee or any conditions under which the fee might be waived or adjusted. Therefore, based on the information provided, the late penalty fee of 1.5% applies to any late payments without further qualifications."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " The Master Service Agreement (MSA) requires the customer to provide a written notice of 30 days before terminating the contract without cause.\n\nIn the provided MSA content, on page 4, it states: \"5.2. Termination. PSP and Client shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon written notice of 30 days.\" This clause specifies the notice period required for either party, which includes the customer (referred to as \"Client\" in the agreement), to terminate the agreement without specifying a cause.\n\nThe question asks for the notice period required for the customer to terminate the contract without cause. The term \"without cause\" typically means that the terminating party does not need to provide a reason for the termination. In this case, the MSA clearly states that a 30-day written notice is required for termination, which applies to both the service provider (PSP) and the customer (Client). The agreement does not differentiate between termination with cause or without cause in this clause, so it can be inferred that the same notice period applies regardless of the reason for termination.\n\nThe thought process involved in reaching this conclusion includes identifying the relevant clause that discusses termination rights and notice periods. The term \"Client\" is understood to mean the customer, and the term \"written notice of 30 days\" is identified as the key information that answers the question.

{"role": "assistant", "content": " Mutual\n\nThe question asks whether the Master Service Agreement (MSA) includes an indemnification clause under which the customer indemnifies the service provider. To answer this question, we need to look for clauses in the MSA that specify the indemnification responsibilities of the parties involved.\n\nUpon reviewing the provided content of the MSA, we find two relevant sections that address indemnification:\n\n1. Section 10.1, as found on page 6, outlines the indemnification obligations of the service provider (PSP). It states that the PSP shall indemnify, defend, and hold the Client harmless from and against any losses incurred by third-party claims related to the Client\u2019s use of PSP Data or infringement of intellectual property rights, subject to certain exceptions.\n\n2. Section 10.2, also on page 6, details the indemnification obligations of the customer (Client). It states that the Client shall indemnify, defend, and hold PSP and its affiliates harmless from any third-party claims related to or arising out of the Client\u2019s use of PSP Data or Platform not as expressly authorized in the Agreement, Client\u2019s failure to comply with laws, or Client\u2019s breach of confidentiality obligations or representations or warranties, except to the extent of PSP\u2019s gross negligence or willful misconduct.\n\nThe presence of both these sections indicates that the MSA contains mutual indemnification clauses. Both the service provider and the customer have obligations to indemnify the other party under certain conditions. This mutual indemnification structure is designed to allocate risks appropriately between the parties based on their respective control over the circumstances that might give rise to a claim.\n\nTherefore, the MSA does include an indemnification clause under which the customer indemnifies the service provider, but it also includes a clause where the service provider indemnifies the customer. The correct characterization of the indemnification structure in this MSA is \"mutual.\""}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " Monthly\n\nThe Master Service Agreement (MSA) provided does not explicitly state the frequency of billing in terms such as \"monthly,\" \"quarterly,\" \"half-yearly,\" or \"annually.\" However, it does provide relevant information that allows us to infer the billing frequency. Specifically, the content on page 6 states, \"Client shall make payment under all invoices within thirty (30) days of receipt of invoice, unless specified differently in the applicable Order Form.\" Additionally, on page 1, it is mentioned that \"All fees shall be due thirty (30) days from the invoice date.\"\n\nFrom these clauses, we can deduce that the billing cycle is likely to be monthly. This is because the payment terms require the client to make payment within thirty days of receiving the invoice or from the invoice date, which is a common practice for monthly billing cycles. If the billing were to be done quarterly, half-yearly, or annually, the payment terms would likely specify a longer period for the payment to be due.\n\nTherefore, based on the standard practice of issuing invoices and the requirement for payment within thirty days, it is reasonable to conclude that the service provider will bill the customer monthly for the services according to this MSA."}

{"role": "user", "content": " Read the question properly and analyze the Master Service Agreement agreement on the basis of this question.\\    \n    Question:'''How much notice does the MSA require the customer to provide before terminating the contract for cause? Provide answer in the form of number of days if possible.'''"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": " The Master Service Agreement (MSA) requires the customer to provide a written notice of 30 days before terminating the contract for cause.\n\nIn the provided MSA content, the relevant section that addresses termination for cause is found on page 4, which states: \"Each Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other Party if the other Party materially breaches any of its obligations under this Agreement and does not cure such material breach within thirty (30) days from the date of notice.\" This clause indicates that a party has the right to terminate the agreement if the other party fails to cure a material breach within 30 days after receiving notice of the breach.\n\nThe question asks for the amount of notice required to terminate the contract for cause. The term \"for cause\" typically refers to a situation where one party is not fulfilling its contractual obligations, which is consistent with the scenario of a material breach described in the MSA. Therefore, the notice period is implicitly linked to the 30-day cure period provided for the breaching party to remedy the breach. If the breaching party fails to cure the breach within this 30-day period, the non-breaching party can then terminate the contract. Hence, the notice period effectively becomes 30 days, as this is the time frame given to the breaching party to address the issue before the contract can be terminated for cause.\n\nIt is important to note that the MSA does not explicitly state a separate notice period for termination for cause beyond the 30-day cure period. Therefore, the answer is based on the interpretation that the cure period also serves as the notice period for termination for cause."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes\n\nThe Master Service Agreement (MSA) does require the service provider to maintain insurance. This requirement is found on page 9 of the MSA, where it states that the service provider should \"cover for potential liability claims which may arise under or in connection with this MSA.\" The use of the term \"cover\" in this context typically refers to maintaining an insurance policy to handle potential liability claims. \n\nThe thought process behind this answer involves understanding that the requirement for insurance coverage is often included in MSAs to protect both parties from potential liabilities that could arise during the performance of the services. The specific language used in the MSA does not explicitly state \"maintain insurance,\" but the phrase \"cover for potential liability claims\" is commonly understood in legal terms to imply that the service provider should have an insurance policy in place to manage such risks. \n\nIn legal contracts, the requirement for insurance is not always stated in simple terms such as \"the service provider must maintain insurance.\" Instead, it can be inferred from the context and the obligations set forth in the agreement. In this case, the obligation to cover potential liability claims is a clear indication that the service provider is expected to have insurance to fulfill this responsibility."}

To find the answer, I analyzed the provided Master Service Agreement (MSA) content for any clauses that discuss the curing of material breaches.\n\nUpon reviewing the content of the MSA, I found a relevant clause on 'page_number': 4, 'content': which states, \"Each Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other Party if the other Party materially breaches any of its obligations under this Agreement and does not cure such material breach within thirty (30) days from the date of\". This clause clearly provides that a party has 30 days to cure a material breach from the date of notice of the breach.\n\nThe thought process involved identifying the term \"material breach\" and any associated actions that could be taken by the parties in the event of such a breach. The term \"cure\" in the context of contract law typically refers to the right of a party who has breached the agreement to remedy the breach within a specified period. The MSA explicitly mentions the time frame of thirty (30) days for curing a material breach, which directly answers the question.\n\nTherefore, based on the MSA provided, the service provider has thirty (30) days to cure a material breach after receiving notice of the breach."}

{"role": "user", "content": " Read the question properly and analyze the Master Service Agreement agreement on the basis of this question.\\    \n    Question:'''How much notice does the MSA require the customer to provide before terminating the contract for cause?

{"role": "assistant", "content": " The Master Service Agreement requires the customer to provide immediate notice upon determining that the other party has materially breached the agreement, with the condition that if the breach is capable of cure, the breaching party must be given 10 days after receiving notice specifying the breach to cure it. Therefore, the notice period required before terminating the contract for cause is effectively immediate for the notice itself, but the termination can only occur after the 10-day cure period has lapsed without the breach being cured.\n\nTo arrive at this conclusion, I analyzed the content provided in the JSON format, particularly focusing on the sections that discuss termination for cause. The relevant section found on page 8 under 'Termination for Material Breach' specifies that a party may terminate the agreement immediately upon notice if the other party materially breaches the agreement. However, it also stipulates that if the breach is capable of being cured, the breaching party must be given an opportunity to cure the breach within 10 days after receiving the notice that specifies the breach.\n\nThis means that while the notice of the breach itself must be given immediately, the actual termination for cause cannot occur until the 10-day period for curing the breach has passed without the breach being remedied. It is important to note that the agreement does not specify a separate notice period for termination itself, only for the notice of breach and the opportunity to cure it.\n\nThe analysis required understanding the difference between notice of breach and notice of termination. In this case, the notice of breach serves as the starting point for the potential termination for cause, with the actual termination being contingent upon the outcome of the cure period. The question's core meaning was to determine the notice period before a termination for cause could take effect, which in this case is immediate for the breach notice, followed by a 10-day cure period."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " Yes\n\nThe Master Service Agreement (MSA) does include a provision for increasing the price of the services. This is explicitly stated in the content provided on page 9, which reads: \"At any time, during the Term, maximum once per calendar year, the Fees shall automatically increase by either 7% or the official inflation rate (based on the Consumer Price Index published in the United States by U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in the month preceding Adverity\u2019s notice of increase), whichever is higher, to support Adverity's continual efforts to expand and enhance its Application Services. Adverity will notify the Customer about an increase of the Fees 60 days in advance.\"\n\nThis clause in the MSA clearly outlines the conditions under which the service provider, Adverity, can increase the fees for the services provided to the customer. The provision allows for an annual price increase, which is tied to the higher of two metrics: a flat rate of 7% or the official inflation rate as measured by the Consumer Price Index. Additionally, the clause specifies that the customer will be given 60 days' notice before any fee increase takes effect.\n\nThe question asked whether the MSA includes a provision for increasing the price of the services, and based on the analysis of the content on page 9, the answer is affirmative.

The term \"Client\" is used here to refer to the customer, and it is specified alongside the name \"Alpha Beta Company,\" making it clear that this is the entity receiving the services under the agreement.\n\nIt is important to note that the term \"customer\" was not used explicitly in the MSA content provided, but the context of the agreement and the use of the term \"Client\" in close association with \"Alpha Beta Company\" allows us to infer that \"Alpha Beta Company\" is indeed the customer referred to in the question. Additionally, the address of the client is mentioned as New Jersey, which further identifies the customer's location but does not affect the identification of the customer's name."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " 30 days\n\nThe question asks for the number of days the service provider has to cure a material breach if the contract provides an opportunity to do so. To find the answer, I analyzed the content of the provided Master Service Agreement (MSA) to locate any clauses that discuss the termination of the agreement for cause, which would typically include provisions for curing a material breach.\n\nUpon reviewing the content of the MSA, I found the relevant clause on 'page_number': 9, 'content': 'days in advance. X.3. Termination for Cause A party may terminate this MSA for cause any time, in particular: a. upon 30 days\u2019 written notice to the other party of a material breach if such breach remains uncured at the expiration of such period; or b. if the assets of the other party become the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or in any other similar proceeding.'\n\nThis clause clearly states that a party may terminate the MSA for cause, specifically upon 30 days' written notice to the other party of a material breach if such breach remains uncured at the expiration of such period. This means that the service provider (or the other party) has 30 days to cure the material breach after receiving written notice of the breach.\n\nThe process of reaching this conclusion involved identifying the section of the MSA that pertains to termination for cause, which is where one would expect to find the terms related to curing a breach. The term \"cure\" is commonly understood in contract law to mean taking action to rectify a breach to the satisfaction of the aggrieved party, thereby preventing termination of the contract for that breach. The MSA specifies the time frame for curing a material breach as 30 days, which directly answers the question posed."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": " Delaware\n\nThe question asks for the governing law of the Master Service Agreement (MSA). In legal agreements, the term \"governing law\" refers to the jurisdiction whose laws will be used to interpret and enforce the terms of the contract. In the provided content of the MSA, the relevant section that mentions the governing law is found on page 7, which states:\n\n\"13.6 Governing Law. This Agreement will be subject to and governed by the laws of the US state of Delaware, without regard to conflicts of laws principles.\"\n\nFrom this excerpt, it is clear that the laws of the state of Delaware in the United States will govern the MSA. The phrase \"without regard to conflicts of laws principles\" indicates that Delaware law will apply even if there are conflicting legal principles in other jurisdictions that might otherwise apply.\n\nTherefore, the governing law for the MSA is the laws of the state of Delaware. This was determined by locating the specific provision in the agreement that explicitly states which jurisdiction's laws will govern the terms and enforcement of the contract."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the content provided from the Commercial Lease Agreement, the specific portion of the property being leased can be determined by examining the language used in the agreement.\n\nThe agreement on page 1 refers to the \"Demised Premises\" and states that the Lessor has agreed to grant the Lessee the Demised Premises with all fittings, fixtures, and furniture installed therein. The term \"Demised Premises\" is typically used in lease agreements to refer to the specific portion of property that is being leased to the tenant. However, the exact nature of the Demised Premises\u2014whether it is an entire building, a specific floor, or a particular suite\u2014is not explicitly defined in the provided content.\n\nThe agreement does not provide a detailed description of the Demised Premises within the excerpts given. It mentions that the premises will be used as the registered office of the Company and that the Lessee has the right to make certain alterations for partitions, chambers, office rooms, etc., which suggests that the leased space may be a portion of a building rather than an entire building. However, without a clear description or reference to an annexure or exhibit that might contain a detailed description of the leased space, it is not possible to conclusively determine the specific portion of the property being leased.\n\nThe reference to Annexure-I in the agreement suggests that there may be a detailed description of the Demised Premises included in that annexure. Since the annexure is not provided in the content excerpts, we cannot rely on it to answer the question.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided in the excerpts of the Commercial Lease Agreement, the specific portion of the property being leased is referred to as the \"Demised Premises,\" but the exact nature of this space (entire building, specific floor, etc.) is not defined within the provided content. Without additional information or access to Annexure-I, the answer to the question cannot be determined from the given data.

TERM AND TERMINATION    Term  This Agreement commences on the Order Effective Date, and it will remain in effect until either  party terminates it as permitted below.    Month-to-Month Services  If the Order specifies no Initial Term with respect to any or all Services, then Provider will deliver  those Services on a month-to-month basis until one party provides written notice to the other  party of its intent to terminate those Services, in which case Provider will cease delivering those  Services at the end of the next calendar month following receipt of such written notice by the  other party.    Trial Period  Provider offers a trial period for a limited number of Services.

NO HIRING  Client shall not solicit for employment with Client any Provider employee with whom Client has  had direct contact in connection with the Services during the Term of this Agreement and for  twelve (12) months following termination of this Agreement.     Client acknowledges that injury resulting from any breach of this provision would be significant  and irreparable and that it would be extremely difficult to ascertain the actual amount of  damages resulting from such breach.

The arbitration will be conducted in English and will have one (1) arbitrator. The  Arbitrator will not have the authority to award punitive damages to either party. Each party will  bear its own expenses, but shall share equally the expenses of the Arbitration Tribunal and the  AAA. Any arbitration award will be final, and judgment thereon may be entered in any court of  competent jurisdiction.  The arbitration will be held in the city where Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s headquarters are  located, or at another location upon which the parties may agree.

{"role": "assistant", "content": " Based on my analysis of the Master Service Agreement agreement, it appears that the customer or client does need to send a notice for claiming indemnification. \n\nOn page 101 of the agreement, it states that if any action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the borrower (customer or client) of the commencement thereof, the borrower will be entitled to participate in the defense of such action. This implies that the borrower needs to be notified in order to claim indemnification.\n\nFurthermore, on page 102, it states that the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert legal defenses and participate in the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party or parties. This suggests that the customer or client needs to send a notice to assert their legal defenses and participate in the defense.\n\nTherefore, based on these provisions in the Master Service Agreement agreement, it can be concluded that the customer or client needs to send a notice for claiming indemnification."}
