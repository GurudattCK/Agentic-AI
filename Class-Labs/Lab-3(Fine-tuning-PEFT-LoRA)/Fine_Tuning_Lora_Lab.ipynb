        "As large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5, LLaMA2, and PaLM2 increase in size, fine-tuning them for specific NLP tasks becomes more resource-intensive.\n",
        "\n",
        "Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) helps reduce computational and memory demands by only adjusting a small set of parameters while keeping most of the model frozen. This prevents losing pre-learned information and allows fine-tuning with minimal compute.\n",
        "\n",
        "The modular design of PEFT allows the same pretrained model to be used for multiple tasks by adding small, task-specific parameters, avoiding the need for storing full model copies.\n",
        "\n",
        "The PEFT library simplifies the process by integrating techniques such as LoRA, Prefix Tuning, AdaLoRA, and more with popular tools like Transformers and Accelerate, enabling scalable fine-tuning of large models.\n"

        "Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools for processing and understanding language, but fine-tuning them for specific tasks can be challenging because of their enormous size and computational demands. This is where Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) comes in, offering an efficient solution for fine-tuning LLMs without needing to adjust every parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of modifying the entire model, LoRA focuses on a small, manageable subset of parameters. Here’s a simplified breakdown of how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Normally, LLMs use a large matrix of parameters (W0) to make decisions. This matrix is huge and computationally expensive to adjust.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. LoRA introduces two smaller matrices, A and B, which are much narrower than W0. These matrices represent a low-rank update to the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Instead of retraining the entire matrix W0, LoRA modifies only these smaller matrices, making the fine-tuning process much faster and more efficient. The result is a model update that’s nearly as effective as full fine-tuning but requires significantly fewer computational resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. In a typical LLM layer, the output is calculated as output = W0x + b0. LoRA adds a new term, BAx, where A and B are the smaller matrices. This allows the model to adapt to new tasks without modifying the original large matrix W0.\n",
