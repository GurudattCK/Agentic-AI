# Welcome to Lab-0

## Here we will learn how to set up google colab. This will be a normal walk-through where we show you how to create a runtime, run code, upload files.

### Pre-requisites
* Google account

### Creating a Runtime
1. After Creating you notebook, you can select which runtime you want to connect to.
2. Click on this button to connect to a default RAM and CPU runtime.

### Uploading any File to the runtime instance.
****Note: The files uploaded to the colab will remain till the runtime is active. Once the runtime is deleted the files will also be deleted.****

1. Once the runtime is connected, click on this button.
