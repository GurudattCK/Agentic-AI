# Lab 4.1: Building Sequential Crew AI Agents in Langflow for MSA Document Processing

## Introduction

In this lab, we'll build a system that takes an MSA (Master Service Agreement) document and analyzes its risks. The system consists of three sequential agents:

1. **Extraction Agent**: Extracts key terms from the document
2. **Comparison Agent**: Compares the extracted key terms with reference values
3. **Report Generation Agent**: Generates a comprehensive summary report

The system also provides an interactive chat interface where users can ask specific questions about the contract, and the appropriate agent(s) will provide detailed responses.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, ensure you have the following:

### 1. Reference Documentation

- [Langflow Documentation](https://docs.langflow.org/)
- [CrewAI Documentation](https://docs.crewai.com/)
- [OpenAI API Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs)

### 2. Required Files

- [‚¨áÔ∏è Download Langflow JSON Template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N401oyaYP-4Ftz3AsZLNd7x8JA7Us6UX/view?usp=sharing)
- [üìÑ Download Sample MSA Document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HPlEXqU-JnpWXe5arqRFXRfvOCtNIJHk/view?usp=sharing)

### 3. API Keys

- OpenAI API Key (Required for the LLM component)

## Importing the Flow in Langflow

### Step 1: Access Langflow

1. Go to [https://langflow.org](https://langflow.org)
2. Click on "Get Started Free" button

### Step 3: Create New Flow

1. After logging in, click on the "New Flow" button in the dashboard

![Step 3: Create New Flow](<Images/Screenshot%20(1517).png>)

### Step 4: Select Blank Flow

1. In the flow creation menu, click on "Blank Flow" to start with an empty template
2. This will open a new workspace where you can build your application

### Step 5: Import JSON Flow File

1. Click on the "Import" button in the upper toolbar
2. Select the downloaded JSON flow file from your computer
3. Wait for the import process to complete
4. The flow components will be automatically loaded into your workspace

### Step 6: View Imported Flow

After successfully importing the JSON file, you will see the complete flow in your workspace. The flow will include all necessary components properly connected, showing the data flow from input to output.

> **Important Note:** After importing, always verify that all nodes are properly connected to each other. Sometimes during import, nodes might become disconnected. Check the flow diagram carefully and reconnect any disconnected nodes by dragging the connection points between them. The data flow should be continuous from the input to the output nodes.

### Step 7: Configure OpenAI API Key

1. Locate the OpenAI API Key component in your flow
2. Click on the component to open its settings
3. Enter your OpenAI API key in the designated field and also provide the OpenAI API key to the Agent component as well

### Step 8: Upload MSA Document

1. Find the Document Upload component in your flow
2. Click on the upload button
3. Select the MSA document you downloaded earlier
4. Wait for the document to be processed

![Step 8: Upload Document](<Images/Screenshot%20(2017).png>)

### Step 9: Test in Playground

1. Click on the "Playground" tab in the top menu
2. You'll see a chat interface where you can:
   - Ask questions about the MSA document
   - Test different types of queries
   - See responses from different agents

### Understanding Agent Responses

When you ask a question:

1. The specialist agent analyzes the relevant parts of the document
2. The response combines insights from the document and agent expertise
3. You'll see which agent provided the answer in the response
