- Now, click on the Playground Section.

![Langflow Screenshot](./Images/Screenshot%20(1553).png)

- In the Playground section, enter a query such as: 'Please provide the input particular user.' The system will fetch and display the output based on the document that you have uploaded.

  Example:

  Input: "Create a table with the following columns: Key Term, Description, and Location in Contract. Populate it with the extracted details of the service provider name, customer name, and termination clauses."
  Output:
  Fetched the answer from the document uploaded by you.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: If no document is found in the upload document, the URL component will fail, and the output generation will not proceed.

# **Deep Dive : Prompt Engineering and Best Practices**


## **Building Blocks of a Prompt:**  
Prompts are not created equal and have ways to get different responses. Here are the building blocks that make a prompt:

- **Instruction** - A specific task or instruction you want the model to perform:  
  *"Find the capital of the top 10 countries by GDP?"*
  
- **Context** - Can involve external information or additional context that can steer the model to better responses.  
  *Context (You are a student listing all countries and their capitals as comma-separated files); Instruction (Find the capital of the top 10 countries by GDP?)*
  
- **Input Data** - The input or question that we are interested in finding a response for.  
  *Context (You are a student, preparing a list of countries and capitals in any order); Input (Can you list the capital of the USA in that format?)*
  
- **Output Indicator** - Indicates the type or format of the output.  
  *Context (You are a student, preparing a list of countries and capitals in any order); Input (Can you list the capital of the USA in the given output format?); Output Format: "Paris; France", "New Delhi; India"*

Like Legos, you can pick up all or any combination of these prompts to perform the task at hand.

## **Methods Used in Prompts**

There are different types of prompts that you can use to interact with large models based on your task:

### **1) Instructions**  
Here, you simply tell the machine what to do, and it does that for you. For example:

**INPUT:**  
```text
Read the following sales email. Remove any personally identifiable information (PII), and replace it with the appropriate placeholder. For example, replace the name "Mahesh Yadav" with "[NAME]".

Hi John,

I'm writing to you because I noticed you recently purchased a new car. I'm a salesperson at a local dealership (Cheap Dealz), and I wanted to let you know that we have a great deal on a new car. If you're interested, please let me know.

Thanks,
Mahesh Yadav  
Phone: 410-805-2345  
Email: initmahesh@gmail.com  
```

**OUTPUT:**  
```text
Hi [NAME],

I'm writing to you because I noticed you recently purchased a new car. I'm a salesperson at a local dealership, and I wanted to let you know that we have a great deal on a new car. If you're interested, please let me know.

Thanks,
[SALESPERSON]
Phone: [PHONE]
Email: [EMAIL]
```

### **2) Role Prompting**  
Here, you assign a role and then ask questions based on that role.

**INPUT:**  
```text
You are a frontend engineer. Now estimate what it takes to build a stunning website for a startup with 10 pages, with very basic interactions and simple functionality. Just give the estimate in weeks, restrict your answer to 2 lines.
```

**OUTPUT:**  
```text
A stunning website for a startup with 10 pages, basic interactions, and simple functionality could take approximately 4-8 weeks to complete. However, the actual time required may vary depending on project-specific requirements and available resources.
```

## **Parameters You Can Tweak**  
We have seen how we can use the above blocks, tune our model response, or get different responses. Here are some parameters that affect the results:

- **Temperature** - Controls randomness. A lower temperature leads to more predictable responses, while a higher value increases creativity.
- **Top_p** - Controls response diversity. A lower value gives exact answers, while a higher value encourages varied responses.

üìå *Recommendation: Alter only one of these at a time.*

- **Penalty** - Discourages overuse of specific words or patterns in the response.

## **Top 10 Best Practices Walkthrough**  
Using our *Contract Summarization App*, we will apply ten best practices for prompt engineering:

1. **Be Specific with Information Requests**  
   üìå *Example:* Extract the service provider name, start and end date of the contract, and the total deal value.

2. **Supply Examples for Context**  
   üìå *Example:* Given the format "Service Provider Name: [Name], Start Date: [Date], End Date: [Date], Deal Value: [Amount]", summarize accordingly.

3. **Include Relevant Data**  
   üìå *Example:* Referencing Section 1.5, summarize the deal value and billing frequency terms.

4. **Specify Desired Output Format**  
   üìå *Example:* Create a table with "Key Term", "Description", and "Location in Contract" columns.

5. **Use Positive Instructions**  
   üìå *Example:* Extract key terms including 'termination for breach' and 'limitations of liability' in JSON format.

6. **Assign a Persona or Frame of Reference**  
   üìå *Example:* Imagine you are a legal analyst. Summarize auto-renewal terms, notice periods, and liabilities.

7. **Implement Chain of Thought Prompting**  
   üìå *Example:* Identify 'termination without cause' clauses ‚Üí Summarize ‚Üí Explain implications.

8. **Break Down Complex Tasks**  
   üìå *Example:* Identify and summarize indemnification terms. Then extract coverage for attorney fees.

9. **Acknowledge the Model's Limitations**  
   üìå *Example:* Extract governing law and indemnification terms. Flag unclear sections for expert review.

10. **Take an Experimental Approach**  
    üìå *Example:* Extract 'termination for cause' using a bullet list, then as a paragraph. Compare clarity.

## **Example Final Prompt for Contract GPT**  

```xml
<Role>
You are an in-house general counsel trained to find liabilities and other clauses from contracts.
</Role>

<Instruction>
Use your legal expertise to review the provided contract document. Your primary goal is to extract and summarize specific terms accurately, following the structured format specified.
</Instruction>

<Task>
1. Extract key terms including 'Service Provider Name', 'Start Date', 'End Date', and 'Deal Value'. Present these in a list format.
2. Review and identify clauses related to 'termination for breach', 'data breach notice', and 'limitations of liability'. Provide a summary in JSON format.
3. Analyze 'auto-renewal' terms and specify the required notice period.
4. Summarize 'indemnification' and 'attorney fees' coverage terms separately.
5. Highlight any ambiguous or unclear language, suggesting further review if necessary.
</Task>

<Guardrails>
1. Be specific and concise in term extraction.
2. Provide summaries in the specified format (JSON, table, or bullet points as directed).
3. Emulate a legal analyst persona.
4. Use positive instructions: focus on terms to include, rather than avoid.
5. Acknowledge model limitations: flag uncertain sections for professional review.
</Guardrails>
