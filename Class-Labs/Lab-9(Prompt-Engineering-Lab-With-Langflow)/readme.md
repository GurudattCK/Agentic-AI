## What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining inputs (prompts) to effectively interact with AI models. The goal is to craft clear, structured, and precise prompts that guide the AI in generating relevant, accurate, and useful responses.

AI models, such as ChatGPT, Gemini etc process natural language inputs and generate text-based outputs based on their training data. The way a prompt is phrased significantly impacts the quality of the response.

# **Deep Dive : Prompt Engineering and Best Practices**


## **Building Blocks of a Prompt:**  
Prompts are not created equal and have ways to get different responses. Here are the building blocks that make a prompt:

- **Instruction** - A specific task or instruction you want the model to perform:  
  *"Find the capital of the top 10 countries by GDP?"*
  
- **Context** - Can involve external information or additional context that can steer the model to better responses.  
  *Context (You are a student listing all countries and their capitals as comma-separated files); Instruction (Find the capital of the top 10 countries by GDP?)*
  
- **Input Data** - The input or question that we are interested in finding a response for.  
  *Context (You are a student, preparing a list of countries and capitals in any order); Input (Can you list the capital of the USA in that format?)*
  
- **Output Indicator** - Indicates the type or format of the output.  
  *Context (You are a student, preparing a list of countries and capitals in any order); Input (Can you list the capital of the USA in the given output format?); Output Format: "Paris; France", "New Delhi; India"*

Like Legos, you can pick up all or any combination of these prompts to perform the task at hand.

## **Methods Used in Prompts**

There are different types of prompts that you can use to interact with large models based on your task:

### **1) Instructions**  
Here, you simply tell the machine what to do, and it does that for you. For example:

**INPUT:**  
```text
Read the following sales email. Remove any personally identifiable information (PII), and replace it with the appropriate placeholder. For example, replace the name "Mahesh Yadav" with "[NAME]".

Hi John,

I'm writing to you because I noticed you recently purchased a new car. I'm a salesperson at a local dealership (Cheap Dealz), and I wanted to let you know that we have a great deal on a new car. If you're interested, please let me know.

Thanks,
Mahesh Yadav  
Phone: 410-805-2345  
Email: initmahesh@gmail.com  
```

**OUTPUT:**  
```text
Hi [NAME],

I'm writing to you because I noticed you recently purchased a new car. I'm a salesperson at a local dealership, and I wanted to let you know that we have a great deal on a new car. If you're interested, please let me know.

Thanks,
[SALESPERSON]
Phone: [PHONE]
Email: [EMAIL]
```

### **2) Role Prompting**  
Here, you assign a role and then ask questions based on that role.

**INPUT:**  
```text
You are a frontend engineer. Now estimate what it takes to build a stunning website for a startup with 10 pages, with very basic interactions and simple functionality. Just give the estimate in weeks, restrict your answer to 2 lines.
```

**OUTPUT:**  
```text
A stunning website for a startup with 10 pages, basic interactions, and simple functionality could take approximately 4-8 weeks to complete. However, the actual time required may vary depending on project-specific requirements and available resources.
```

---

## **Parameters You Can Tweak**  
We have seen how we can use the above blocks, tune our model response, or get different responses. Here are some parameters that affect the results:

- **Temperature** - Controls randomness. A lower temperature leads to more predictable responses, while a higher value increases creativity.
- **Top_p** - Controls response diversity. A lower value gives exact answers, while a higher value encourages varied responses.

üìå *Recommendation: Alter only one of these at a time.*

- **Penalty** - Discourages overuse of specific words or patterns in the response.

---

# **How AI Models Process Prompts**  

AI models like GPT work by predicting the most likely next word based on the input prompt. The way you structure the prompt **directly influences** the response quality.

- **A vague prompt** results in **ambiguous** or **generic** responses.  
- **A detailed, structured prompt** provides **precise, high-quality** responses.  

---

## **Poor vs  Good Prompting**  

### **üî¥ Poor Prompt:**  
```text
Input 
Extract these Information from the document: Key Term, Description, and Location in Contract. 
```
![Langflow Screenshot](./Images/Screenshot%20(1589).png)

```text
Output
Here are some key terms extracted from the document along with their descriptions and locations in the contract:

1. **Key Term:** Kaseya Master Agreement  
   **Description:** A binding legal contract between Kaseya and the entity making purchases under this Agreement.  
   **Location in Contract:** Introduction (Effective as of April 1, 2024)

2. **Key Term:** Scope  
   **Description:** Governs the interactions between the customer and Kaseya, including access to Kaseya portals and platforms, and the right to purchase Kaseya Products.  
   **Location in Contract:** Section 1(a)

3. **Key Term:** Product Terms of Use  
   **Description:** Terms applicable to the use, marketing, resale, and distribution of Kaseya Products.  
   **Location in Contract:** Section 1(a)

4. **Key Term:** License  
   **Description:** The right to use a Product pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and as defined in the applicable Documentation.  
   **Location in Contract:** Section 2(c)

5. **Key Term:** End User  
   **Description:** The person or entity that purchases a Product for its own use and owns, licenses, or uses Content.  
   **Location in Contract:** Section 16

6. **Key Term:** Confidential Information  
   **Description:** Any business, operational, and/or technical information that is designated as confidential or that a reasonable person would believe to be confidential.  
   **Location in Contract:** Section 7(a)

7. **Key Term:** Termination for Convenience  
   **Description:** Either party may terminate the Agreement at any time without cause upon 30 calendar days written notice.  
   **Location in Contract:** Section 9(b)

8. **Key Term:** Indemnification  
   **Description:** Obligations of Kaseya and the customer to defend and hold harmless against certain claims.  
   **Location in Contract:** Section 11

9. **Key Term:** Governing Law  
   **Description:** The laws of the State of Delaware, USA, govern all disputes arising out of the Agreement.  
   **Location in Contract:** Section 14(a)

10. **Key Term:** Fair Use  
    **Description:** Policies that prohibit excessive use of Products that harms Kaseya's resources or circumvents the intended use of the Product.  
    **Location in Contract:** Section 2(f)

These terms provide a foundational understanding of the Kaseya Master Agreement and its key components.
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Issue With This Prompt**
Lack of Output Format Specification.The prompt does not specify how the extracted information should be formatted (e.g., table, JSON, bullet points).This can lead to inconsistent or unstructured responses.

---

### **üü¢ Improved Prompt:**
```text
Input
 Create a table with the following columns: Key Term, Description, and Location in Contract. Populate it with the extracted details of the service provider name, customer name, and termination clauses.
```
![Langflow Screenshot](./Images/Screenshot%20(1590).png)

```text
Output
Here's a table with the requested details extracted from the Kaseya Master Agreement:

| Key Term                     | Description                                                                                     | Location in Contract                       |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Service Provider Name         | Kaseya US, LLC (for customers in the United States)                                           | Exhibit A                                 |
| Customer Name                 | The entity making purchases under this Agreement (referred to as "you")                       | Introduction (first paragraph)            |
| Termination for Convenience    | Either party may terminate the Agreement at any time, without cause, upon 30 days written notice. | Section 9(b)                             |
| Termination for Material Breach | Each party may terminate the Agreement upon notice if the other party materially breaches and fails to cure within 30 days. | Section 9(c)                             |
| Effect of Termination         | Upon termination, the customer may not order or sell additional Products without consent, and all rights and licenses will terminate. | Section 9(d)                             |

This table summarizes the key terms related to the service provider name, customer name, and termination clauses as specified in the Kaseya Master Agreement.
```

‚úÖ Why This Works:
- The response is in a table format, which enhances readability and organization.
- Each key term is properly categorized under three columns:
   - Key Term (What is being defined)
   - Description (Brief explanation)
   - Location in Contract (Where it is found in the document)

1. **Be Specific with Information Requests**  
   üìå *Example:* Extract the service provider name, start and end date of the contract, and the total deal value.

2. **Supply Examples for Context**  
   üìå *Example:* Given the format "Service Provider Name: [Name], Start Date: [Date], End Date: [Date], Deal Value: [Amount]", summarize accordingly.

3. **Include Relevant Data**  
   üìå *Example:* Referencing Section 1.5, summarize the deal value and billing frequency terms.

4. **Specify Desired Output Format**  
   üìå *Example:* Create a table with "Key Term", "Description", and "Location in Contract" columns.

5. **Use Positive Instructions**  
   üìå *Example:* Extract key terms including 'termination for breach' and 'limitations of liability' in JSON format.

6. **Assign a Persona or Frame of Reference**  
   üìå *Example:* Imagine you are a legal analyst. Summarize auto-renewal terms, notice periods, and liabilities.

7. **Implement Chain of Thought Prompting**  
   üìå *Example:* Identify 'termination without cause' clauses ‚Üí Summarize ‚Üí Explain implications.

8. **Break Down Complex Tasks**  
   üìå *Example:* Identify and summarize indemnification terms. Then extract coverage for attorney fees.

9. **Acknowledge the Model's Limitations**  
   üìå *Example:* Extract governing law and indemnification terms. Flag unclear sections for expert review.
