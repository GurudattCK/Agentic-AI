        "## Introduction to Multi-Agent Framework\n",
        "A multi-agent framework refers to a system where multiple autonomous agents collaborate, interact, and work together to accomplish tasks that would otherwise be difficult or time-consuming for a single agent. Each agent typically has a specific role or goal and brings its own expertise to the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Components:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Agents:\n",
        "\n",
        "Independent entities within the system that perform tasks.\n",
        "Collaboration: Agents working together to achieve a common goal.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Memory:\n",
        "\n",
        "The ability of agents to remember past interactions and utilize that information in future tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Focus:\n",
        "\n",
        "The specialization of agents, each focusing on a specific sub-task to break down complex problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Reflection:\n",

        "# Key Elements of Multi-Agent Framework\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1.  Role Playing\n",
        "\n",
        "Each agent has a distinct role, which allows it to specialize in a certain part of the task. Role playing is the foundation of the multi-agent system, as it ensures that each agent contributes effectively to the overall goal.\n",
        "\n",
        "In our example, the agents have the following roles:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Text Extraction Agent: Extracts text from the provided PDF contract.\n",
        "- Comparison Agent: Compares the extracted data with predefined reference data.\n",
        "- Reporting Agent: Generates an email-friendly report summarizing the analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Focus\n",
        "\n",
        "Focus refers to how agents specialize in particular sub-tasks, each of them focusing on specific elements of the broader task. By dividing a large task into smaller, focused sub-tasks, agents can perform them efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, in the contract analysis:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The Text Extraction Agent focuses on extracting text from the contract.\n",
        "- The Comparison Agent focuses on comparing the extracted data to the reference standards.\n",
        "- The Reporting Agent focuses on generating a report summarizing the analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Tools\n",
        "\n",
        "Each agent uses tools to complete its task. A tool could be a function, an API, or any external resource that assists an agent in performing its task.\n",
        "\n",
        "In our case, agents use the following tools:\n",
        "\n",
        "- PDF Text Extractor: For extracting text from the PDF contract.\n",
        "- Reference Data Comparator: For comparing the extracted data to predefined reference standards.\n",
        "- Email Report Generator: For creating a detailed report summarizing the analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Cooperation\n",
        "\n",
        "Cooperation in multi-agent systems is when agents collaborate, sharing information and working together to accomplish the final goal. Agents rely on each other's output to proceed with their task. This collaboration is key to the success of the overall system.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the contract analysis example:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The Text Extraction Agent extracts text, which is then passed to the Comparison Agent.\n",
        "- The Comparison Agent checks the extracted data against the reference data, and the results are passed to the Reporting Agent.\n",
        "- The Reporting Agent uses the comparison results to generate a final report.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 5. Guardrails\n",
        "Guardrails are mechanisms that ensure agents behave correctly and avoid issues such as infinite loops or repeating tasks unnecessarily. Guardrails enforce limits and constraints to ensure the system remains efficient and accurate.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, we can use guardrails to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Ensure that each task is executed only once (avoiding redundant processing).\n",
        "- Make sure that tasks follow the right order (e.g., text extraction before comparison).\n",
        "- Prevent agents from getting stuck in loops (e.g., if the text extraction fails, it should not be retried endlessly).\n",
        "\n",
        "## 6. Memory\n",
        "Memory is the ability of agents to store and retrieve information. This allows them to keep track of previous interactions and use that information for future tasks. In multi-agent systems, memory can be divided into three types:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Short-term memory: Temporary data stored for a single task.\n",
        "- Long-term memory: Persistent data that can be shared across tasks.\n",
        "- Entity memory: Memory related to specific entities (like documents or companies).\n",
        "\n",
        "Each agent in our system uses memory to store outputs of its tasks and share that information with other agents."
