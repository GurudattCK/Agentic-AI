# Welcome to Lab 0.1
## In this Lab we will show you how to Generated/analyse contracts using GPT-3.5-turbo 16k context length.
### We will also stumble across an error which might seem like the end of the world but we will fix it using a, awesome technique called RAG, so hang tight.

### Pre-requisites

1. AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT
2. AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY
3. AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT
4. AZURE_OPEN_AI_MODEL
5. OPENAI_API_TYPE
6. Python version 3.9+ (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
7. VS code(Optional if you are using Google Colab) (https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

### *** You can either use GPT-3.5 key from OpenAI, or deploy an instance in Azure like us and use it endpoints. ***
